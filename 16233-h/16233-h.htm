<p align = "center"><tt><u>INTRODUCTION</u></tt></p>

<p><tt>The <u>Essay</u> here reproduced was first advertised in
the London <u>Daily</u> <u>Advertiser</u> as "this day was
published" on Thursday, 17 May 1744 (The same advertisement,
except for the change of price from one shilling to two, appeared
in this paper intermittently until 14 June). Although on the
title-page the authorship is given as "By the Author of a Letter
from a By-stander," there was no intention of anonymity, since
the Dedication is boldly signed "Corbyn Morris, Inner Temple,
Feb. 1, 1743 [44]."<br>
<br>
Not much is known of the early life of Corbyn Morris. Born 14
August 1710, he was the eldest son of Edmund Morris of Bishop's
Castle, Salop. (<u>Alumni</u> <u>Cantabrigienses</u>). On 17
September 1727 he was admitted (pensioner) at Queen's College,
Cambridge, as an exhibitioner from the famous Charterhouse
School. Exactly when he left the university, or whether he took a
degree, is not certain.<br>
<br>
Morris first achieved some prominence, though anonymously, with
<u>A Letter from a By-stander to a Member of Parliament; wherein
is examined what necessity there is for the maintenance of a
large regular land-force in this island</u>. This pamphlet, dated
at the end, 26 February 1741/42, is a wholehearted eulogy of the
Walpole administration and is filled with statistics and
arguments for the Mercantilist theories of the day. At the time
there was some suspicion that the work had been written either by
Walpole himself or by his direction. When the <u>Letter from a
By-stander</u> was answered by the <span class = "pagenum">-2-
</span>historian Thomas Carte, an angry pamphlet controversy
ensued, with Morris writing under the pseudonym of "A Gentleman
of Cambridge." Throughout, Morris showed himself a violent Whig,
bitter in his attacks on Charles II and the non-jurors; and it
was undoubtedly this fanatical party loyalty which laid the
foundation for his later government career.<br>
<br>
The principal facts of Morris's later life may be briefly
summarized. On 17 June 1743 he was admitted at the Inner Temple.
Throughout the Pelham and Newcastle administrations he was
employed by the government, as he once put it, "in conciliating
opponents." From 1751 to 1763 be acted as Secretary of the
Customs and Salt Duty in Scotland, in which post he was
acknowledged to have shown decided ability as an administrator.
From 1763 to 1778 he was one of the commissioners of customs. He
died at Wimbledon 22 December 1779 (<u>Musgrave's</u>
<u>Obituary</u>), described in the <u>Gentleman's</u>
<u>Magazine</u> as a "gentleman well known in the literary world,
and universally esteemed for his unwearied services and
attachment to government."<br>
<br>
Throughout his long years of public service he wrote numerous
pamphlets, largely on economic and political questions. Merely
the titles of a few may be sufficient to indicate the nature of
his interests. <u>An Essay towards Deciding the Question whether
Britain be Permitted by Right Policy to Insure the Ships of Her
Enemies </u>(1747); <u>Observations on the Past Growth and
Present State of the City of London</u> (containing a complete
table of christenings and burials 1601-1750) (175l); <u>A Letter
Balancing the Causes of the Present Scarcity of Our Silver
Coin</u> (1757).<br>
<br>
<span class = "pagenum">-3-</span>
It would be a mistake, however, to consider Morris merely as a
statistical economist and Whig party hack. A gentleman of taste
and wit, the friend of Hume, Boswell, and other discerning men of
the day, he was elected F.R.S. in 1757, and appears to have been
much respected. In later life Morris had a country place at
Chiltern Vale, Herts., where he took an active delight in country
sports. One of his late pamphlets, not listed in the
<u>D.N.B</u>. account of him, entertainingly illustrates one of
his hobbies. <u>The Bird-fancier's Recreation and Delight, with
the newest and very best instructions for catching, taking,
feeding, rearing, &amp;c all the various sorts of SONG BIRDS...
containing curious remarks on the nature, sex, management, and
diseases of ENGLISH SONG BIRDS, with practical instructions for
distinguishing the cock and hen, for taking, choosing, breeding,
keeping, and teaching them to sing, for discovering and caring
their diseases, and of learning them to sing to the greatest
perfection</u>.<br>
<br>
Although there is little surviving evidence of Morris's purely
literary interests, a set of verses combining his economic and
artistic views appeared in a late edition of <u>The New Foundling
Hospital for Wit</u> (new edition, 1784, VI, 95). Occasioned by
seeing Bowood in Wiltshire, the home of the Earl of Shelburne,
the lines are entitled: "On Reading Dr. Goldsmith's Poem, the
Deserted Village."<br>
<br>
This was the man who at the age of thirty-three brought out
<u>An</u> <u>Essay</u> <u>towards</u> <u>Fixing</u> <u>the</u>
<u>True</u> <u>Standards</u> <u>of</u> <u>Wit</u>, <u>Humour</u>,
<u>Raillery</u>, <u>Satire</u>, <u>and</u> <u>Ridicule</u>. That
it was ever widely read we have no evidence, but at least a
number of men of wit and judgment found it interesting. <span
class = "pagenum">-4-</span>Horace Walpole included it in a
packet of "the only new books at all worth reading" sent to
Horace Mann, but the fulsome dedication to the elder Walpole
undoubtedly had something to do with this recommendation. More
disinterested approval is shown in a letter printed in the
<u>Daily</u> <u>Advertiser</u> for 31 May 1744. Better than any
modern critique the letter illustrates the contemporary reaction
to the <u>Essay</u>.</tt></p>

<blockquote>
<tt>SIR:<br>
<br>
I have examin'd the <u>Essay</u> you have sent me for <u>fixing
the true Standards of Wit, Humour, &amp;c.</u> and cannot
perceive upon what pretence the Definitions, as you tell me, are
censured for Obscurity, even by Gentlemen of Abilities, and such
as in other Parts of the Work very frankly allow it's Merit: the
Definition of Wit, which presents itself at first, you say is,
particularly objected to, as dark and involv'd; in answer to
which I beg Leave to give you my plain Sentiments upon it, and
which I apprehend should naturally occur to every Reader: In
treating upon Wit, the Author seems constantly to carry in his
View a Distinction between <u>This</u> and <u>Vivacity</u>: there
is a Lustre or Brilliancy which often results from wild
unprovok'd Sallies of Fancy; but such unexpected Objects, which
serve not to <u>elucidate</u> each other, discover only a Flow of
Spirits, or rambling Vivacity; whereas, says he, Wit is the
Lustre which results from the quick <u>Elucidation</u> of one
Subject, by the just and unexpected Arrangement of it with
another Subject.--To constitute <u>Wit</u>, there must not only
arise a <u>Lustre</u> from the quick Arrangement together of two
Subjects, but the new Subject must be naturally introduced, and
also serve to <u>elucidate</u> the original one: the Word
<u>Elucidation</u>, though it be not new, is elegant, and very
happily applied in this Definition; yet I have seen some old
Gentlemen here stumble at it, and have found it difficult to
persuade them to advance farther:--I have also heard Objections
made to the Words <u>Lustre</u> and <u>Brilliancy</u> of Ideas,
though they are Terms which have been used by the <u>Greeks</u>
and <u>Romans</u>, and by elegant Writers of all Ages and
Nations; and the Effect which they express, is  perfectly
conceiv'd and felt by every Person of true Genius and
Imagination.<br>
<br>
The Distinctions between <u>Wit</u> and <u>Humour</u>, and the
Reasons why <u>Humour</u> is more pleasurably felt than
<u>Wit</u>, are new and excellent: as is the Definition of an
<u>Humourist</u>, and the happy Analysis of the Characters of
<u>Falstaff</u>, <u>Sir Roger de Coverly</u>, and <u>Don
Quixote</u>; But, as you say, the Merit of these Parts is
universally allowed; as well as the Novelty, <span class =
"pagenum">-5-</span>and liberal Freedom of the [word apparently
omitted]; which have such Charms in my Eye, as I had long ceased
to expect in a Modern Writer.<br>

</blockquote>
<br>
<p><tt>If the "Gentlemen of Abilities" of the day found some of
Morris's definitions obscure, modern readers will find them more
precise than those of most of his predecessors. All who had gone
before--Cowley, Barrow, Dryden, Locke, Addison, and Congreve (he
does not mention Hobbes)--Morris felt had bungled the job. And
although he apologizes for attempting what the great writers of
the past had failed to do, he has no hesitation in setting forth
exactly what he believes to be the proper distinctions in the
meanings of such terms as wit, humour, judgment, invention,
raillery, and ridicule. The mathematician and statistician in
Morris made him strive for precise accuracy. It was all very
clear to him, and by the use of numerous anecdotes and examples
he hoped to make the distinctions obvious to the general
reader.<br>
<br>
The <u>Essay</u> shows what a man of some evident taste and
perspicacity, with an analytical mind, can do in defining the
subtle semantic distinctions in literary terms. Trying to fix
immutably what is certain always to be shifting, Morris is
noteworthy not only because of the nature of his attempt, but
because he is relatively so successful. As Professor Edward
Hooker has pointed out in an Introduction to an earlier
<u>ARS</u> issue (Series I, No. 2), his is "probably the best and
clearest treatment of the subject in the first half of the
eighteenth century." It may be regretted that political and
economic concerns occupied so much of his later life, leaving him
no time for further literary essays.<br>
<br>
<span class = "pagenum">-6-</span>In the present facsimile
edition, for reasons of space, only the Introduction and the main
body of the <u>Essay</u> are reproduced. Although Morris once
remarked to David Hume that he wrote all his books "for the sake
of the Dedications" (<u>Letters</u> <u>of</u> <u>David</u>
<u>Hume</u> ed. Greig, I, 380), modern readers need not regret
<ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads 'too much of the omission'">too much
the omission</ins> of the fulsome 32 page
dedication to Walpole (The Earl of Orford). Morris insists at the
beginning that the book was inspired by a fervent desire of
"attempting a Composition, independent of Politics, which might
furnish an occasional Amusement" to his patron. The praise which
follows, in which Walpole is said to lead "the <u>Empire</u> of
<u>Letters</u>," is so excessive as to produce only smiles in
twentieth century readers. Walpole is praised for <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads 'not curbing the theatre;'">not
curbing the press while necessarily curbing the theatre,</ins>
his aid to commerce, indeed almost every act of his
administration, is lauded to the skies. The Church of England, in
which "the <u>Exercise</u> of <u>Reason</u> in the solemn Worship
of God, is the sacred <u>Right</u>, and indispensible
<u>Duty</u>, of Man," receives its share of eulogy. In every
connection the Tories are violently attacked.<br>
<br>
The Dedication ends in a peroration of praise for Walpole's
public achievements which "shall adorn the History of
<u>Britain</u>," and for his "<u>Private</u> <u>Virtues</u> and
all the <u>softer</u> <u>Features</u>" of his mind. His home of
retirement is referred to in the lines of Milton:<br>
<br>
&emsp;"Great Palace now of Light!<br>
&emsp;Hither, as to their Fountain, other Stars<br>
&emsp;Repairing, in their golden Urns, draw Light;<br>
&emsp;And here [sic] the Morning Planet gilds her Horns."<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[P.L. 7. 363-66]<br>
<br>
"Thus splendid, and superior, your Lordship now flourishes in
honourable Ease, exerting universal Benevolence...." But in
dedications, as in <span class = "pagenum">-7-</span>lapidary
inscriptions, as Dr. Johnson might have agreed, a writer need not
be upon oath.<br>
<br>
At the end of the <u>Essay</u> Morris reprinted two essays from
<u>The Spectator</u>, Nos. 35 and 62, and William Congreve's "An
Essay concerning Humour in Comedy. To Mr. Dennis" (Congreve's
<u>Works</u>, ed. Summers,
III, 161-68). Since these are readily available, they have not
been included in this edition.<br>

"essaysmallcaps">Wit, Humour, Raillery, Satire</span> and <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Ridicule</span>, I am sensible, is no
easy or slight Undertaking. To give a <i>Definition</i> of <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, has been declared by Writers
of the greatest Renown, to exceed their Reach and Power; and
Gentlemen of no less Abilities, and Fame, than <i>Cowley,</i>
<i>Barrow,</i> <i>Dryden,</i> <i>Locke,</i> <i>Congreve,</i> and
<i>Addison,</i> have tryed their Force upon this Subject, and
have all left it free, and unconquered. This, I perceive, will be
an Argument with some, for condemning an <i>Essay</i> upon this
Topic by a young Author, as rash and presumptious. But, though I
desire to pay all proper Respect to these eminent Writers, if a
tame Deference to great Names shall become fashionable, and the
Imputation of Vanity be laid upon those who examine their Works,
all Advancement in Knowledge will be absolutely stopp'd; and
<i>Literary</i> Merit will be soon placed, in an <i>humble
Stupidity,</i> and <i>solemn Faith</i> in the Wisdom of our
Ancestors.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
<p>Whereas, if I rightly apprehend, <i>an Ambition  to excell</i>
is the Principle which should animate a Writer, directed by a
<i>Love</i> of <i>Truth,</i> and a <i>free Spirit</i> of
<i>Candour</i> and <i>Inquiry</i>. This is the <i>Flame</i> which
should warm the rising Members of every Science, not a poor
Submission to those who have preceded. For, however it may be
with a <i>Religious</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Devotion</span>, a <i>Literary</i> One is
certainly the <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Child</span> of
<i>Ignorance</i>.</p>

<p>However, I must acknowledge, that where I have differed from
the great Authors before mentioned, it has been with a
Diffidence, and after the most serious and particular Examination
of what they have delivered. It is from hence, that I have
thought it my Duty, to exhibit with the following <i>Essay,</i>
their several Performances upon the same Subject, that every
Variation of mine from their Suffrage, and the Reasons upon which
I have grounded it, may clearly appear.</p>

<br>

<p>The <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Wit</i> of this <i>Ode</i> are
excellent; and yet it is evident, through the whole, that Mr.
<i>Cowley</i> had no clear Idea of <i>Wit,</i> though at the same
time it <i>shines</i> in most of these Lines: There is little
Merit in saying what <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>
<i>is not,</i> which is the chief Part of this <i>Ode</i>.
Towards the End, he indeed attempts to describe what <i>it
is,</i> but is quite vague and perplex'd in his Description; and
at last, instead of collecting his scatter'd Rays into a
<i>Focus,</i> and exhibiting succinctly the clear Essence and
Power of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, he drops the
whole with a trite Compliment.</p>

<p>The learned Dr. <i>Barrow,</i> in his <i>Sermon against
foolish Talking and Jesting,</i> gives the following profuse
Description of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<blockquote>
<i>But first it may be demanded, What the Thing we speak of is?
Or what the Facetiousness</i> (or <i>Wit</i> as he calls it
before) <i>doth import? To which Questions I might reply, as</i>
Democritus <i>did to him that asked the Definition of a Man,</i>
'Tis that we all see and know. <i>Any one better apprehends what
it is by Acquaintance, than I can inform him by Description. It
is indeed a Thing so versatile and multiform, appearing in so
many Shapes, so many Postures, so many Garbs, so variously
apprehended  by several Eyes and Judgments, that it seemeth no
less hard to settle a clear and certain Notion thereof, than to
make a Portrait of</i> Proteus, <i>or to define the Figure of the
fleeting Air. Sometimes it lieth in pat Allusion to a known
Story, or in seasonable Application of a trivial Saying, or in
forging an apposite Tale: Sometimes it playeth in Words and
Phrases, taking Advantage from the Ambiguity of their Sense, or
the Affinity of their Sound: Sometimes it is wrapp'd in a Dress
of humorous Expression: Sometimes it lurketh  under an odd
Similitude: Sometimes it is lodged in a sly Question, in a smart
Answer, in a quirkish Reason, in a shrewd Intimation, in
cunningly diverting, or cleverly retorting an Objection:
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
Sometimes it is couched in a bold Scheme of Speech, in a tart
Irony, in a lusty Hyperbole, in a startling Metaphor, in a
plausible Reconciling of Contradictions, or in acute Nonsense;
Sometimes a scenical Representation of Persons or Things, a
counterfeit Speech, a mimical Look or Gesture passeth for it.
Sometimes an affected Simplicity, sometimes a presumptuous
Bluntness giveth it Being. Sometimes  it riseth from a lucky
Hitting upon what is Strange; sometimes from a crafty wresting
obvious Matter to the Purpose. Often it' consisteth in one knows
not what, and springeth up one can hardly tell how. Its ways are
unaccountable, and inexplicable,  being answerable to the
numberless Rovings of Fancy, and Windings of Language.  It is, in
short, a Manner of Speaking  out of the simple and plain Way
(such as Reason teacheth, and proveth Things by) which by a
pretty, surprizing Uncouthness  in Conceit or Expression, doth
affect and amuse the Fancy, stirring in it some Wonder, and
breeding some Delight thereto. It raiseth Admiration, as
signifying a nimble Sagacity of Apprehension, a special Felicity
of Invention, a Vivacity  of Spirit, and Reach of Wit, more than
vulgar; it seeming to argue a rare</i>
<span class = "folionum">b</span>
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<i>Quickness of Parts, that one can fetch in remote Conceits
applicable; a notable Skill that he can dextrously accommodate
them to the Purpose before him; together with a lively Briskness
of Humour, not apt to damp those Sportful Flashes of Imagination.
(Whence in </i>Aristotle<i> such Persons  are termed</i> <ins
class = "correction" title = "text may read 'epidezioi'"><span
class = "greek">epidexioi</span></ins>, <i>dexterous Men, and</i>
<span class = "greek">eutropoi</span>, <i>Men of facile or
versatile Manners, who can easily turn themselves to all Things,
or turn all Things to themselves.)  It also procureth Delight, by
gratifying Curiosity with its Rareness, or Semblance of
Difficulty. (As Monsters,  not for their Beauty, but their
Rarity; as juggling Tricks, not for their Use, but their
Abstruseness, are beheld with Pleasure;) by diverting the Mind
from its Road of serious Thoughts, by instilling Gaiety, and
Airiness of Spirit; by provoking to such Disposition of Spirit in
Way of Emulation, or Complaisance; and by seasoning Matters
otherwise distasteful or insipid, with an unusual and thence
grateful Tange.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>This Description, it is easy to perceive, must have cost the
Author of it a great deal of Labour. It is a very full Specimen
of that Talent of entirely <i>exhausting</i> a Subject, for
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
which Dr. <i>Barrow</i> was remarkable; and if the <i>Point</i>
was, to exhibit all the various Forms and Appearances, not of
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> only, but of
<i>Raillery,</i> <i>Satire,</i> <i>Sarcasms,</i> and of every
Kind of <i>Poignancy</i> and <i>Pleasantry</i> of Sentiment, and
Expression, he seems to have perfectly succeeded; there being
perhaps no Variety, in all the Extent of these Subjects, which he
has not presented to View in this Description.--But he does not
pretend to give any <i>Definition</i> of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, intimating rather that it is quite
impossible to be given: And indeed from his Description of it, as
a <i>Proteus,</i> appearing in numberless various Colours, and
Forms; and from his mistaking, and presenting for <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, other different Mixtures and
Substances, it is evident that his Idea of it was quite confused
and uncertain: It is true, he has discovered a vast Scope of
Fertility of Genius, and an uncommon Power of collecting together
a Multitude of Objects upon any Occasion, but he has here
absolutely mistaken his work; for instead of exhibiting the
Properties of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> in a
clearer Light, and confuting the <i>false Claims</i> which are
made to it, he has made it his whole Business to perplex it the
more, by introducing, from all Corners, a monstrous Troop of new
unexpected <i>Pretenders</i>.</p>

<span class = "folionum">b2</span>
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<p><i>Dryden,</i> in the Preface to his <i>Opera,</i> entitled,
<i>The State of Innocence,</i> or <i>Fall of Man,</i> gives the
following <i>Decree</i> upon <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<i>The</i> Definition of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, <i>(which has been so often
attempted, and ever unsuccessfully  by many Poets) is only this:
That it is</i> a Propriety of Thoughts and Words; or in other
Terms, Thoughts and Words elegantly adapted to the Subject.
</blockquote>

<p>If Mr. <i>Dryden</i> imagined, that he had succeeded
<i>himself</i> in this <i>Definition,</i> he was extremely
mistaken; for nothing can be more distant from the Properties of
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, than those he
describes. He discovers no Idea of the <i>Surprize,</i> and
<i>Brilliancy</i> of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>,
or of the sudden <i>Light</i> thrown upon a Subject. Instead of
once pointing at these, he only describes the Properties of clear
<i>Reasoning,</i> which are <i>a Propriety of Thoughts and
Words</i>;--Whereas <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, in
its sudden <i>Flashes,</i> makes no Pretension to
<i>Reasoning</i>; but is perceived in the pleasant
<i>Surprize</i> which it starts, and in the <i>Light</i> darted
upon a Subject, which instantly vanishes again, without abiding a
strict Examination.</p>

<p>The other Definition he gives, which is, <i>Thoughts and Words
elegantly adapted to the Subject,</i> is very different from the
former, but equally unhappy.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<p>For <i>Propriety,</i> in <i>Thoughts</i> and <i>Words,</i>
consists in exhibiting <i>clear, pertinent Ideas,</i>
in <i>precise</i> and <i>perspicuous Words</i>.</p>

<p>Whereas <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Elegance</span>
consists in the <i>compt,</i> <i>well pruned</i> and <i>succinct
Turn</i> of a Subject.</p>

<p>The Object of the <i>First,</i> is to be <i>clear,</i> and
<i>perspicuous</i>; whence it often appears in pursuit of these,
not <i>compt</i> or <i>succinct</i>: Whereas the <i>Essence</i>
of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Elegance</span> is to be
<i>compt</i> and <i>succinct,</i> for the Sake of which Ornaments
it often neglect <i>Perspicuity,</i> and <i>Clearness</i>.--In
short, a <i>Propriety</i> of Thoughts and Words, may subsist
without any <i>Elegance</i>; as an <i>Elegance</i> of Thoughts
and Words may appear without a perfect <i>Propriety</i>.</p>

<p>The last <i>Definition,</i> as it is thus very different from
the former is also equally unhappy: For <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Elegance</span> is no <i>essential</i> Property
of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>. <i>Pure</i> <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> resulting solely from the
<i>quick Elucidation</i> of one Subject, by the sudden
<i>Arrangement,</i> and <i>Comparison</i> of it, with another
Subject.--If the two Objects <i>arranged</i> together are
<i>elegant,</i> and <i>polite,</i> there will then be superadded
to the <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, an
<i>Elegance</i> and <i>Politeness</i> of Sentiment, which will
render the <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> more
amiable. But if the Objects are <i>vulgar,</i> <i>obscene,</i> or
<i>deformed,</i> provided the <i>first</i> be <i>elucidated,</i>
in a lively Manner, by, the sudden <i>Arrangement</i> of it with
the <i>second,</i> there will be equally <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; though, the
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
Indelicacy of Sentiment attending it, will render such <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> shocking and abominable.</p>

<p>It is with the highest Respect for the great Mr. <i>Locke,</i>
that I deliver his Sentiments upon this Subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<i>And hence, perhaps, may be given some Reason of that common
Observation, that Men who have a great deal of</i> Wit, <i>and
prompt Memories, have not always the clearest Judgment or deepest
Reason: For</i> Wit <i>lying most in the Assemblage  of</i>
Ideas, <i>and putting those together with Quickness and Variety,
wherein can be found any Assemblance or Congruity, thereby to
make up pleasant Pictures, and agreeable Visions in the
Fancy</i>. Judgment, <i>on the contrary, lies quite on the other
side; in separating carefully one from another,</i> Ideas,
<i>wherein can be found the least Difference, thereby to avoid
being missed by Similitude, and by Affinity to take one thing for
another. This is a Way of proceeding quite contrary to Metaphor
and Allusion; wherein for the most Part lies that Entertainment
and Pleasantry of</i> Wit, <i>which strikes so lively on the
Fancy, and therefore is acceptable to all People, because its
Beauty appears at first Sight, and there is required no Labour of
Thoughts
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
to examine what Truth, or Reason, there is in it. The Mind,
without looking any further, rests satisfied with the
Agreeableness of the Picture, and the Gaiety of the Fancy. And it
is a kind of an Affront to go about to examine it by the severe
Rules of Truth, and good Reason, whereby it appears, that it
conflicts in something that is not perfectly conformable to
them.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>It is to be observed that Mr. <i>Locke</i> has here only
occasionally, and passantly, delivered his Sentiments upon this
Subject; but yet he has very happily explained the chief
Properties of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>. It was
<i>his</i> Remark <i>First,</i> that it lies for the most
<i>Part</i> in <i>assembling</i> together with <i>Quickness</i>
and <i>Variety</i> Objects, which possess an <i>Affinity,</i> or
<i>Congruity,</i> with each other; which was the <i>first</i>
just Information obtained by the literary World, upon this
Subject.</p>

<p>As to what he adds, That the Intention, and Effects, of this
<i>Assemblage</i> of <i>similar</i> Objects, is <i>to make up
pleasant Pictures, and agreeable Visions in the Fancy,</i> it is,
as I humbly apprehend, not quite perfect: For the Business of
this <i>Assemblage</i> is not merely to raise pleasant Pictures
in the Fancy, but also to <i>enlighten</i> thereby the
<i>original</i> Subject.--This  is evident; because in such
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<i>Assemblages,</i> the only Foundation upon which the <i>new
Subject</i> is suddenly introduced, is the <i>Affinity,</i> and
consequently the <i>Illustration,</i> it bears to the
<i>first</i> Subject.--The Introduction of pleasant Pictures and
Visions, which present not a new <i>Illustration,</i> and
<i>Light,</i> to the <i>original</i> Subjects, being rather wild
Sallies of <i>Vivacity,</i> than well-aimed, apposite Strokes of
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>.</p>

<p>It is Mr. <i>Locke</i>'s Conclusion, at last, That <span class
= "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> <i>consists in something that is
not perfectly conformable to Truth, and good Reason</i>.--This is
a <i>Problem</i> of some Curiosity; and I apprehend Mr.
<i>Locke</i>'s Determination upon it to be right:--For the
<i>Direction</i> of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> is
absolutely different from the <i>Direction of</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Truth</span> and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Good Reason</span>; It being the Aim of <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> to strike the
<i>Imagination</i>; of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Truth</span> and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Good Reason</span>, to convince the
<i>Judgment</i>: From thence they can never be perfectly
coincident.</p>

<p>It is however true, that there may be Instances of <span class
= "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, wherein the <i>Agreement</i>
between the two Objects shall be absolutely <i>just,</i> and
perceived to be such at the first Glance. Such Instances of <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, will be then also <i>Self-
evident</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Truths</span>. They
will <i>both</i> agree in their obvious, and quick
<i>Perspicuity</i>; but will be still different in this, that the
Effort of the <i>One</i> is to strike the
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<i>Fancy,</i> whereas the <i>Other</i> is wholly exerted in
gratifying the <i>Judgment</i>.</p>

<p>The Sentiments of Mr. <i>Addison</i> upon <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, are professedly delivered in the
<i>Spectator</i> Nº. 62. annexed to the following <i>Essay</i>.
He has there justly commended Mr. <i>Locke</i>'s Description of
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; but what he adds, by
Way of Explanation to it, that the <i>Assemblage</i> of Ideas
must be such as shall give <i>Delight,</i> and <i>Surprize,</i>
is not true, in regard to the Former, <i>Delight</i> being no
<i>essential</i> Property of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; for if the <i>original</i> Subject
be unpleasant, or deformed, the sudden unexpected
<i>Arrangement</i> of a <i>similar</i> Object with it, may give
us <i>Surprize,</i> and be indisputably <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, and yet be far from creating any
<i>Delight</i>.</p>

<p>This Gentleman has also given the following Example, in order
to illustrate the Necessity there is, that <i>Surprize</i> should
be always an Attendant upon <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>. <i>"When a Poet tells us, the Bosom
of his Mistress is as white as Snow, there is no</i> Wit <i>in
the Comparison; but when he adds, with a Sigh, that it as cold
too, it then grows to Wit.</i>" --To compare a Girl's
<i>Bosom</i> to <i>Snow</i> for its <i>Whiteness</i> I apprehend
to be <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, notwithstanding
the Authority of so great a Writer to the contrary. For there is
a <i>Lustre</i> resulting from the <i>natural</i> and
<span class = "folionum">c</span>
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<i>splendid Agreement</i> between these Objects, which will
<i>always</i> produce <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>;
such, as cannot be destroyed, though it will quickly be rendered
<i>trite,</i> by frequent Repetition.</p>

<p>This <i>Problem,</i> <i>How far</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Surprize</span> <i>is, or is not, necessary
to</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, I humbly
apprehend, may be thus solved.--In Subjects which have a
<i>natural</i> and <i>splendid Agreement,</i> there will always
be <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> upon their
<i>Arrangement</i> together; though when it becomes <i>trite,</i>
and not accompanied with <i>Surprize,</i> the <i>Lustre</i> will
be much faded;--But where the <i>Agreement</i> is <i>forced</i>
and <i>strained,</i> <i>Novelty</i> and <i>Surprize</i> are
absolutely necessary to usher it in; An unexpected
<i>Assemblage</i> of this Sort, striking our Fancy, and being
gaily admitted at first to be <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; which upon frequent Repetition, the
<i>Judgment</i> will have examined, and rise up against it
wherever it appears;--So that in short, in Instances where the
<i>Agreement</i> is <i>strained</i> and <i>defective,</i> which
indeed are abundantly the most general, <i>Surprize</i> is a
necessary <i>Passport</i> to <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; but <i>Surprize</i> is not necessary
to <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, where the
<i>Agreement</i> between the two Subjects is <i>natural</i> and
<i>splendid</i>; though in these Instances it greatly heightens
the <i>Brillancy</i>.</p>

<p>The subsequent Remark of Mr. <i>Addison,</i> <i>That the Poet,
after saying his Mistress's
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
Bosom is as white as Snow, should add, with a Sigh, that it is as
cold too, in order that it may grow to</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, is I fear, very incorrect. For as to
the <i>Sigh,</i> it avails not a Rush; and this Addition will be
found to be only a <i>new</i> Stroke of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, equally <i>trite,</i> and less
perfect, and natural, than the former Comparison.</p>

<p>It may also be observed, That Mr. <i>Addison</i> has omitted
the <i>Elucidation</i> of the <i>original</i> Subject, which is
the grand Excellence of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>. Nor has he prescribed any
<i>Limits</i> to the Subjects, which are to be arranged together;
without which the Result will be frequently the <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Sublime</span> or <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Burlesque</span>; In which, it is true, <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> often appears, but taking
their whole Compositions together, they are different Substances,
and usually ranked in different <i>Classes</i>.</p>

<p>All that Mr. <i>Congreve</i> has delivered upon <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, as far as I know, appears in his
<i>Essay</i> upon <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>,
annexed to this Treatise. He there says, <i>"To define</i> <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, <i>perhaps, were as
difficult, as to define</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; <i>for, like that, it is of infinite
Variety"</i>. --Again, he afterwards adds, <i>"But though we
cannot certainly tell what</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span><i> is, or what</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> <i>is, yet we may</i> go near
<i>to shew something, which is not</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, <i>or not</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, <i>and yet often
<span class = "folionum">c2</span>
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
mistaken for both"</i>. --In this <i>Essay,</i> wherein he
particularly considers <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, and the Difference between
<i>this,</i> and <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, he
may be expected to have delivered his best Sentiments upon both:
But these Words, which I have quoted, seem to be as important and
precise, as any which he has offered upon the Subject of <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>. As such, I present them,
without any Remarks, to my Reader, who, if he only <i>goes
near</i> to be <i>edified</i> by them, will discover a great
Share of <i>Sagacity</i>.</p>

<p>The Sentiments of these eminent Writers upon <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, having thus been exhibited, I come
next to the Subject of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>. This has been <i>defined</i> by
some, in the following Manner, with great <i>Perspicuity.</i>--
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> is the genuine <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> of <i>Comedies,</i>--which
has afforded vast Satisfaction to many <i>Connoissures</i> in the
<i>Belles Lettres</i>; especially as <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> has been supposed to be incapable of
any <i>Definition.</i></p>

<p>This Subject has also been particularly considered by the
<i>Spectatator</i> Nº. 35. inserted at the End of the following
<i>Essay</i>. Mr. <i>Addison</i> therein <i>gravely</i> remarks,
that <i>"It is indeed much easier to describe what is not</i>
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, <i>than what it
is;"</i> which, I humbly apprehend, is no very <i>important</i>
Piece of Information.--He adds, <i>"And
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
very difficult to define it otherwise, than as</i> Cowly <i>has
done</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, <i>by
Negatives."</i> This Notion of <i>defining</i> a Subject by
<i>Negatives,</i> is a favourite <i>Crotchet,</i> and may perhaps
be assumed upon other Occasions by future Writers: I hope
therefore I shall be pardoned, if I offer a proper Explanation of
so good a <i>Conceit</i>;--To declare then, <i>That a Subject is
only to be</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Defined</span>
<i>by</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Negatives</span>, is to
cloath it in a <i>respectable</i> Dress of <i>Darkness</i>. And
about as much as to say, That it is a <i>Knight</i> of
<i>tenebrose Virtues</i>; or a <i>serene Prince,</i> of the
<i>Blood</i> of <i>Occult Qualities</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Addison</i> proceeds, <i>"Were I to give my own Notions
of</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, <i>I should
deliver them after</i> Plato's <i>Manner, in a Kind of Allegory;
and by supposing</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>
<i>to be a Person, deduce to him, all his Qualifications,
according to the following Genealogy</i>: <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Truth</span> <i>was the Founder of the Family,
and the Father of</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Good Sense;
Good Sense</span> <i>was the Father of</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, <i>who married a Lady of a
collateral Line called</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Mirth</span>, <i>by whom he had Issue</i> <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>". --It is very unfortunate
for this <i>Allegorical</i> Description, that there is not one
Word of it just: For <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Truth, Good
Sense, Wit</span>, and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Mirth</span>, represented to be the immediate
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
<i>Ancestors</i> of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>;
whereas <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> is derived
from the <i>Foibles,</i> and whimsical <i>Oddities</i> of
<i>Persons</i> in real Life, which flow rather from their
<i>Inconsistencies,</i> and <i>Weakness,</i> than from <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Truth</span> and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Good Sense</span>; Nor is <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> any <i>Ancestor</i> of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, but of a quite different
<i>Family</i>; it being notorious that much <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> may be drawn from the Manners of
<i>Dutchmen,</i> and of the most formal and dull Persons, who are
yet never guilty of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>.
Again, <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Mirth</span> is not so
properly the <i>Parent</i> of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, as the <i>Offspring</i>.--In
short, this whole <i>Genealogy</i> is a <i>nubilous</i> Piece of
Conceit, instead of being any <i>Elucidation</i> of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>. It is a formal Method of
trifling, introduced under a deep Ostentation of Learning, which
deserves the severest Rebuke.--But I restrain my Pen,
recollecting the <i>Visions</i> of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Mirza</span>, and heartily profess my high
Veneration for their admirable Author.</p>

<p>The <i>Essay</i> upon <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, at the End of this Treatise,
written by Mr. <i>Congreve,</i> is next to be considered. It
appears, that at first he professes his absolute Uncertainty in
regard to this Subject; and says, "<i>We cannot certainly tell
what</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> <i>is, or
what</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> <i>is</i>."
But yet, through his whole Piece, he neglects the Subject of
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> in general, and only
discourses upon the <span class = "pagenum">xxii</span><span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, by which he means barely
the <i>Disposition,</i> of Persons: This may particularly appear
from the following Words.</p>

<blockquote>
<i>"A Man may change his Opinion, but I believe he will find it a
Difficulty to part with his</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>; <i>and there is nothing more
provoking than the being made sensible of that Difficulty.
Sometimes we shall meet with those, who perhaps indifferently
enough, but at the same time impertinently, will ask the
Question,</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Why are you not
merry? Why are you not gay, pleasant, and chearful?</span>
<i>Then instead of answering, could I ask such a Person,</i>
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Why are you not handsome? Why have
you not black Eyes, and a better Complexion?</span> <i>Nature
abhors to be forced.</i><br>
<br>
<i>"The two famous Philosophers of</i> Ephesus <i>and</i> Abdera,
<i>have their different Sects at this Day. Some weep, and others
laugh at one and the same Thing.</i><br>
<br>
<i>"I don't doubt but you have observed several Men laugh when
they are angry; others, who are silent; some that are loud; yet I
cannot suppose that it is the Passion of</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Anger</span>, <i>which is in itself different,
or more or less in one than t'other, but that it is the</i> <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> <i>of the Man that is
predominant, and urges him to express it <span class =
"pagenum">xxiii</span>in that Manner. Demonstrations of</i> <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Pleasure</span>, <i>are as various: One
Man has a</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> <i>of
retiring from all Company, when any thing has happened to please
him beyond Expectation; he hugs himself alone, and thinks it an
Addition to the Pleasure to keep it a Secret,</i> &amp;c."
</blockquote>

<p>All which, I apprehend, is no more than saying; That there are
different <i>Dispositions</i> in different <i>Persons</i>.</p>

<p>In another Place, he seems to understand by <i>Humour,</i> not
only the <i>Disposition,</i> but the <i>Tone</i> of the
<i>Nerves,</i> of a Person, thus,</p>

<blockquote>
<i>"Suppose</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Morose</span>
<i>to be a Man naturally splenetic, and melancholy; is there any
thing more offensive to one of such a</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Disposition</span> (where he uses the Word
instead of <i>Humour</i>) <i>than Noise and Clamour? Let any Man
that has the Spleen (and there are enough in England) be Judge.
We see common Examples of this</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> <i>in little every Day. 'Tis ten
to one, but three Parts in four of the Company  you dine with,
are discomposed, and started at the cutting of a Cork, or
scratching of a Plate with a Knife; it is a Proportion of the
same</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, <i>that
makes such, or any other Noise, offensive to the Person that
hears it; for there are others who will not be disturbed at all
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>by it."</i>
</blockquote>

<p>At this Rate every <i>Weakness</i> of <i>Nerves,</i> or
<i>Particularity</i> of <i>Constitution,</i> is <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>.</p>

<p>It is true, he justly points out in another Place the
different Sentiments, which ought to be adapted to different
<i>Characters</i> in <i>Comedy,</i> according to their different
<i>Dispositions,</i> or, as he phrases it, <i>Humours</i>: As for
Instance, he very rightly observes, <i>That a Character of a
splenetic and peevish</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, <i>Should have a satirical</i>
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>. <i>A jolly and
sanguine</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>
<i>should have a facetious</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>. --But still this is no Description
of what is well felt, and known, by the general Name of <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>.</p>

<p>However, as what I have already quoted, may appear to be only
his looser Explanations, it will be necessary to deliver his more
closed and collected Sentiments upon this Subject. These he gives
in the following Words,</p>

<blockquote>"I should be unwilling to venture, even in a bare
<i>Description</i> of <i>Humour,</i> much more to make a
<i>Definition</i> of it; but now my Hand is in, I will tell you
what serves me instead of either. I take it to be, <i>A singular
and unavoidable Manner of doing or saying any thing, peculiar and
natural to one Man only, by which his Speech and Actions are
distinguished from those of other Men</i>."
</blockquote>

<p>--This
<span class = "folionum">d</span>
<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
Description is very little applicable to <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, but tolerably well adapted to
other Subjects.--Thus, a Person, who is happy in a particular
<i>Grace,</i> which accompanies all his Actions, may be said to
possess <i>a singular and unavoidable Manner of doing or saying
any thing, peculiar and natural to him only, by which his Speech
and Actions are distinguished from those of other Men</i>. And
the same may be said of a Person of a peculiar <i>Vivacity,</i>
<i>Heaviness,</i> or <i>Awkwardness</i>.--In  short, this
Description is suited to any <i>Particularity</i> of a Person in
general, instead of being adapted to the <i>Foibles</i> and
<i>whimsical Oddities</i> of Persons, which alone constitute
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>.</p>

<p>These are the only Pieces upon <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, which have fallen within my
Knowledge; I have here fairly delivered them at length; and from
the Respect which is due to such eminent Writers, have distinctly
and deliberately examined the Merit of each.--As to my own
<i>Performance,</i> which is now submitted to the Public, I have
to wish, that it may gain a candid and strict Examination. It has
been my Endeavour to give <i>Definitions</i> of the Subjects,
upon which I have treated; A <i>Plan</i> the most difficult of
all others to be executed by an Author; But such an one, as I
apprehend, deserves to be <span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>more
generally introduced, and established. If once it was expected by
the Public, that <i>Authors</i> should strictly <i>define</i>
their Subjects, it would instantly checque an Inundation of
Scribbling. The <i>desultory</i> Manner of Writing would be
absolutely exploded;  and <i>Accuracy</i> and <i>Precision</i>
would be necessarily introduced upon every Subject.</p>

<p>This is the <i>Method</i> pursued in Subjects of
<i>Philosophy</i>; Without clear and precise <i>Definitions</i>
such noble Advances could never have been made in those Sciences;
And it is by the Assistance of <i>these</i> only, that Subjects
of <i>Polite Literature,</i> can ever be enlightened and
embellished with just Ornaments. If <i>Definitions</i> had been
constantly exacted from Authors there would not have appeared
<i>one hundreth</i> Part of the present Books, and yet every
Subject had been better ascertained.--Nor will this Method, as
some may imagine, be encumbered with Stiffness; On the contrary,
in <i>illustrating</i> the Truth of <i>Definitions</i> there is a
full Scope of the utmost Genius, Imagination, and Spirit of a
Writer; and a Work upon this <i>Plan</i> is adorned with the
highest Charms appearing with <i>Propriety,</i> <i>Clearness,</i>
and <i>Conviction,</i>  as well as Beauty.</p>

<span class = "folionum">d2</span>
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<p>It is true, that the Difficulties, which attend an able
Execution of this <i>Method,</i> are not open to a careless Eye;
And it is some Mortification to an <i>Author</i> upon this
<i>Plan,</i> that his greatest <i>Merit</i> is likely to lie
concealed; A <i>Definition,</i> or <i>Distinction,</i> which
after much Attention and Time he has happily delivered with
<i>Brevity</i> and <i>Clearness,</i> appearing hereby quite
obvious, to others, and what they cannot imagine could require
Pains to discover.</p>

<p>As to the <i>Examples,</i> by which I have illustrated the
<i>Definition</i> of <i>Wit,</i> they are <i>common</i> and
<i>trite</i>; but are the best, which I could find upon
deliberate Enquiry. Many Modern instances of <i>Wit,</i> which
left very lively Impressions upon me, when I heard them,
appearing upon Re-examination to be quite strained and defective.
These, which I have given, as they are thus <i>trite,</i> are not
designed in themselves for any Entertainment to the Reader; but
being various, and distant from each other, they very properly
serve to explain the Truth, and Extent of the
<i>Definition</i>.</p>

<p>The Character of an <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humourist</span>, I expect, will be strange to
most of my Readers; and if no Gentleman is acquainted with a
<i>Person</i> of this <i>Cast,</i> it must pass for a <i>Mon<span
class = "pagenum">xviii</span>ster</i> of my own Creation;--As to
the Character of Sir <i>John Falstaff,</i> it is chiefly
extracted from <i>Shakespear,</i> in his 1st Part of King
<i>Henry</i> the <i>IVth</i>; But so far as <i>Sir John</i> in
<i>Shakspear's</i> Description, sinks into a <i>Cheat</i> or a
<i>Scoundrel,</i> upon any Occasion, he is different from that
<i>Falstaff,</i> who is designed in the following <i>Essay,</i>
and is entirely an amiable Character.</p>

<p>It is obvious, that the Appearance, which <i>Falstaff</i>
makes, in the unfinished Play of <i>The Merry Wives of
Windsor,</i> is in general greatly below his true Character. His
Imprisonment and Death in the latter Part of King <i>Henry</i>
the <i>IVth,</i> seem also to have been written by
<i>Shakespear</i> in Compliance with the <i>Austerity</i> of the
Times; and in order to avoid the Imputation of encouraging
<i>Idleness</i> and mirthful <i>Riot</i> by too amiable and happy
an Example.</p>

<p>The Criticism, which I have made, upon <i>Horace</i>'s
Narrative of his <i>Adventure</i> with an <i>Impertinent
Fellow,</i> I offer with Respect; And beg leave to observe that
the chief Part which I object to, is the <i>Propriety</i> of his
introducing himself in so <i>ridiculous a Plight</i>;</p>
<span class = "pagenum">xxix</span>
<div class = "verse">
&emsp;<i>----Dum sudor ad imos<br>
Manaret Talos;</i>
</div>
<p>And</p>
<div class = "verse">
<i>Demitto Auriculas, ut iniquæ mentis Acellus<br>
Cum gravius dorso subiit onus.</i>
</div>

<p>And other Representations of the same sort, seem to place
<i>Horace</i> in a very mean and ludicrous Light; which it is
probable he never apprehended in the full Course of exposing his
Companion;--Besides, the Conduct of his Adversary is in several
Places, excessively, and, as it may be construed,
<i>designedly,</i> insolent and contemptuous; and as no Merit or
Importance belongs to this Person, there appears no Reason why
<i>Horace</i> should endure such Treatment; or, if the other was
too <i>powerful</i> for him, it is not an <i>Adventure</i> of
<i>Honour</i>; or what <i>Horace</i> should chuse to expose to
the World in this manner, with all the Particulars of his own
despicable Distress.</p>

<p>However, the <i>Mirth</i> which results from this Narrative,
as it now stands, is perhaps rather the stronger at first, by the
full <i>Ridicule</i> which lies against <i>Horace,</i> and his
Adversary;--But, upon Reflection, there arises a Disgust, at the
Impropriety of <i>Ho<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>race's</i>
exposing his own <i>Meanness,</i> as well as at the nauseous
<i>Impudence</i> of his Companion.</p>

<p>As to <i>uncommon</i> Words, if any such appear in this
<i>Introduction,</i> or in the following <i>Essay,</i> I hope
they want neither <i>Propriety,</i> <i>Clearness,</i> nor
<i>Strength</i>;--And if the <i>Length</i> of this Piece to an
<i>Essay</i> so <i>short</i> shall happen at first to
<i>disturb</i> any <i>Critic,</i> I beg leave to inform him, that
all, which can be fairly collected from it, is only, that it may
have cost <i>me</i> the more Trouble;--But upon mentioning the
<i>Length</i> of this Piece, what behoves me the most, is, to
return my Thanks to two <i>Gentlemen,</i> who suffered me to read
to them the whole, as it was gradually written; And by whose
<i>judicious</i> and <i>friendly Instructions</i> in the Course
of it, my own <i>Imagination</i> was often prevented from running
into <i>Riots</i>.</p>

<p>However, I am far from imagining, that I have always been
reduced within just Bounds; And now feel a sufficient Share of
<i>Concern</i> and <i>Anxiety,</i> for the <i>Fate</i> of this
Work;--Yet, I humbly apprehend, that <i>this</i> must freely be
allowed me, that I have not been a <i>Plagiary</i>; But have
constantly delivered my own <i>original</i> Sentiments, without
<i>purloining</i> or <i>disfiguring</i> the Thoughts
<span class = "pagenum">xxxi</span>
of others; An <i>Honesty,</i> which, I hope, is laudable in an
<i>Author</i>; And as I have not <i>stolen,</i> neither have I
<i>concealed,</i> the <i>Merit</i> of other Writers.</p>

<p>It will also be found, as I humbly apprehend, that I have
never <i>shunned</i> the Subject: I mention this particularly,
because it is the Practice of many eminent Writers, after much
<i>curvetting</i> and <i>prauncing,</i> suddenly to wheel, and
retire, when they are expected to make their most full Attack.--
These Gentlemen, it is true, very happily avoid <i>Danger,</i>
and advance and retreat in <i>excellent Order</i>: But, with
their Leave, I must observe that they never do any
<i>Execution</i>; For Subjects, which have not been surveyed, and
laid open, are like <i>fortified Places</i>; and it is the
Business of a <i>Writer,</i> as well as of a <i>Soldier,</i> to
make an Attack;--This has been the Conduct I have held in the
following <i>Essay</i>; and however I may be <i>shattered</i>
upon any Occasion, I hope it will appear (if I may be allowed the
Expression) that I have fairly <i>charged</i> the Subjects.</p>

<p>Having offered these Circumstances in my Favour, I must
frankly acknowledge, that I am not able to plead any <i>Hurry</i>
or <i>Precipitancy</i> in the publishing of this Work, in Excuse
of its Errors; Though I clearly un<span class =
"pagenum">xxxii</span>derstand, that by making this Discovery, I
absolutely deprive myself of the most <i>genteel</i> and
<i>fashionable Screen</i> now used by Authors;--But I imagined,
that it became me to spare no Labour or Attention upon a Work,
which I should presume to offer to the World; Happening to esteem
this <i>Care</i> and <i>Concern,</i> a <i>Respect</i> due to the
<i>Public,</i> and the proper Species of <i>Humility</i> and
<i>Modesty</i> in an <i>Author</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">W</span>IT <i>is the</i> <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Lustre</span> <i>resulting from the
quick</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Elucidation</span> <i>of
one Subject, by a</i> just <i>and</i> unexpected <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Arrangement</span> <i>of it with another
Subject.</i></p>

<p>This <i>Definition</i> of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> will more clearly appear by a short
Explanation.</p>

<p>It is the Province of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> to <i>elucidate,</i> or
<i>enlighten</i> a Subject, not by reasoning upon that Subject,
but by a just and unexpected Introduction of another
<i>similar,</i> or <i>opposite</i> Subject; whereby, upon their
<i>Arrangement</i> together, the <i>original</i> Subject may be
<i>set off,</i> and more clearly <i>enlighten'd,</i> by their
obvious Comparison.</p>

<p>It may be proper, for the sake of Distinction, to call the
Subject, which is the Basis
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
and Ground-work, the <i>original</i> Subject; and that which is
introduced, in order to <i>elucidate</i> it, the <i>auxiliary</i>
Subject.</p>

<p>That there be always an apparent Chain or Connexion, or else
an obvious Agreement or Contrast, between the two Subjects, is
absolutely requir'd, in order that the <i>Auxiliary</i> one may
be <i>justly</i> introduced; otherwise, instead of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, there will only appear a rambling
<i>Vivacity,</i> in wild, unprovoked Sallies.</p>

<p>And yet <i>every just</i> or <i>natural</i> Introduction of an
<i>auxiliary</i> Subject will not produce <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, unless a new <i>Lustre</i> is
reflected from thence upon the <i>original</i> Subject.</p>

<p>It is further to be observed, that the Introduction of the
<i>auxiliary</i> Subject ought not only to be <i>just,</i> but
also <i>unexpected,</i> which are entirely consistent together;
For as every Subject bears various Relations and Oppositions to
other Subjects, it is evident that each of these Relations and
Oppositions upon being exhibited, will be <i>unexpected</i> to
the Persons, who did not perceive them before; and yet they are
<i>just</i> by Supposition.</p>

<p>It is upon such <i>unexpected</i> Introductions of
<i>auxiliary</i> Subjects, that we are struck with a
<i>Surprize</i>; from whence the high <i>Brilliancy</i> and
<i>Sparkling</i> of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>,
result.</p>

<p>Whereas <i>Auxiliary</i> Subjects, introduced upon such
Occasions, as they have been frequently exhibited before, are apt
to fall dull, and heavy upon the Fancy; and unless they
<span class = "folionum">B2</span>
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
possess great natural Spirit, will excite no sprightly
Sensation.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to observe, that, in <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, the Subjects concern'd must be
<i>ordinary</i> and <i>level</i>; By which are intended, not such
as are <i>common,</i> but such as have no <i>extraordinarily
exalted,</i> or <i>enlarged,</i> Qualities; and are not
<i>unsizeable</i> in the particular Circumstances in which they
are compared to each other;--otherwise it is easy to perceive,
that the Result of their <i>Arrangement</i> will not be so
properly <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, as either the
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Sublime</span>, or <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Burlesque</span>.</p>

<p>To all this is to be added, that either <i>Gallantry</i>,
<i>Raillery</i>, <i>Humour</i>, <i>Satire</i>, <i>Ridicule</i>,
<i>Sarcasms</i>, or other Subjects, are generally blended with
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; It has been for want
of this Discovery, and of a proper Separation of these Subjects,
that the Attempts which have hitherto been made to <i>define</i>
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, have been all involv'd
and overwhelm'd in Perplexity; For the different Mixtures of
these foreign Ingredients with <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, have discover'd such various and
opposite <i>Colours</i> and <i>Substances,</i> as were impossible
to be comprehended in one certain steady <i>Definition</i>;--
Whereas <i>pure</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>
alone, constantly appears in <i>one uniform</i> Manner; which is,
<i>In the </i>quick Elucidation<i> of one Subject, by
</i>unexpectedly<i> exhibiting its </i>Agreement<i> or
</i>Contrast<i> with another Subject</i>.</p>

<p>It is proper in this Place, to distinguish between <span class
= "essaysmallcaps">Wit, Similes</span>, and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Metaphors</span>.
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Similes</span>, though they
<i>illustrate</i> one Subject, by <i>arranging</i> it with
another Subject, are yet different from <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, as they want its <i>sudden</i> and
<i>quick Elucidation</i>.</p>

<p>Again; In <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, the
<i>Elucidation</i> is thrown only upon <i>one</i> Point of a
Subject; or if more Points be <i>elucidated,</i> they are so many
different Strokes of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>;--
Whereas every <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Simile</span>
touches the Subject it <i>illustrates</i> in <i>several
Points</i>.</p>

<p>It is from hence, that the <i>Elucidation,</i> as before
mention'd, arising from a <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Simile</span>, is <i>slower</i> than from <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; But then is is generally
more <i>accurate</i> and <i>compleat</i>;--In short, <span class
= "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, from its <i>Quickness,</i>
exhibits more <i>Brilliancy,</i> But <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Similes</span> possess greater
<i>Perfection</i>.</p>

<p><i>A </i><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Metaphor</span><i>, is
the </i>Arrayment<i> of one Subject,
with the </i>Dress<i>, or </i>Colour<i>, or any
</i>Attributes<i>, of another Subject</i>.</p>

<p>In <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, the two Subjects
are suddenly confronted with each other, and upon their joint
View, the <i>original</i> one is <i>elucidated</i> by the obvious
<i>Agreement</i> or <i>Contrast</i> of the <i>auxiliary</i>
Subject.</p>

<p>But <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Metaphor</span> goes
further, and not content with <i>arranging</i> the two Subjects
together, and exhibiting from thence their <i>Agreement</i> or
<i>Contrast,</i> it actually snatches the Properties of the
<i>auxiliary</i> one, and fits them at once upon the
<i>original</i> Subject.</p>

<p>It is evident from hence, that there may be <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> without any <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Metaphor</span>; But in every
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
just <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Metaphor</span> there is
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; The <i>Agreement</i>
of the two Subjects being in a <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Metaphor</span> more strictly and sensibly
presented.</p>

<p>There is also this Difference between <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Metaphor</span>, that in <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> the <i>original</i> Subject is
<i>enlighten'd,</i> without altering its <i>Dress</i>; whereas in
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Metaphor</span> the
<i>original</i> Subject is cloathed in a <i>new Dress,</i> and
struts forwards at once with a different <i>Air,</i> and with
strange <i>unexpected Ornaments</i>.</p>

<p>It is from hence, that by <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Metaphor</span> a more masculine Air and Vigour
is given to a Subject, than by <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; But it too often happens, that the
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Metaphor</span> is carried so far,
as instead of <i>elucidating,</i> to obscure and disfigure, the
<i>original</i> Subject.</p>

<p>To exhibit some Examples of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>.</p>

<p><i>Henry</i> the IVth of <i>France,</i> intimating to the

Naples; To which the Ambassador added, <i>Since your Majesty
travels at this rate, you may be at Vespers in</i> Sicily.</p>

<p>The Introduction of the <i>Vespers</i> at <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Sicily</span> is here <i>natural,</i> and easy;
as it seems only to be carrying on his Majesty's Journey at the
same rate, and to compleat the Progress of the Day; But it ushers
at once into View the <span class =
"pagenum">6</span><i>Destruction</i> of the <i>French</i> upon a
<i>similar</i> Occasion, when they formerly over-ran <span class
= "essaysmallcaps">Sicily</span>, and were all massacred there at
the ringing of the Bell for <i>Vespers</i>;--The sudden
Introduction and <i>Arrangement</i> of this Catastrophe, with the
Expedition then threaten'd, sets the Issue of such a Conquest in
a new <i>Light</i>; And very happily exhibits and
<i>elucidates</i> the Result of such vain and restless
Adventures.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that the <i>quick</i> Introduction and
<i>Arrangement</i> of any former Conquest of <i>Italy</i> by the
<i>French,</i> with the Expedition then threaten'd, would have
exhibited <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>; whatever the
Issue had been of such former Conquest; But in this Instance,
there sits couched under the <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, a very <i>severe Rebuke</i> upon the
<i>French</i> Monarch.</p>
<br>
<p align = "center">2.</p>
<p><i>Alexander</i> the VIth was very busily questioning the
Ambassador of <i>Venice,</i> Of whom his Masters held their
Customs and Prerogatives of the Sea? To which the Ambassador
readily answer'd; <i>If your</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Holiness</span> <i>will only please to examine
your Charter of St.</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Peter</span>'s <i>Patrimony, you will find upon
the Back of it, the Grant made to the</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Venetians</span> <i>of the</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Adriatic</span>.</p>

<p>The Authority of the <i>Grant</i> to the <i>Venetians</i> is
in this Instance the <i>original</i> Subject, which is thus
suddenly <i>elucidated</i> to the <i>Pope,</i> by
<i>arranging,</i> and connecting it with the holy <span class =
"pagenum">7</span><i>Charter</i> of St. <i>Peter's</i> Patrimony;
There is a peculiar Happiness in the Address of this Answer to
the <i>Pope,</i> as he was obliged to receive it as a
satisfactory Account of the Truth of the <i>Grant,</i> and a
clear <i>Elucidation</i> of its sacred Authority.</p>

<p>In this Instance, besides the <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> which shines forth, the <i>Pope</i>
is severely expos'd to your <i>Raillery,</i> from the Scrape into
which he has brought the <i>Charter</i> of St. <i>Peter</i>'s
Patrimony, by his Attack of the <i>Ambassador</i>; The
<i>fictitious</i> Existence of both the <i>Charter</i> and
<i>Grant</i> being sarcastically pointed out, under this
respectable Air of <i>Authenticity</i>.</p>
<br>
<p align = "center">3.</p>
<p>Upon the Restoration Mr. <i>Waller</i> presented a
congratulatory Copy of Verses to King <i>Charles</i>; His
Majesty, after reading them, said,--<i>Mr</i>. Waller, <i>these
are very good, but not so fine as you made upon the</i> <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Protector</span>.--To which Mr.
<i>Waller</i> return'd,--<i>Your Majesty will please to
recollect, that we Poets always write best upon</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Fictions</span>.</p>

<p>The <i>original</i> Subject in this Instance is <i>the
superior Excellence of Mr</i>. <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Waller</span>'s <i>Verses upon</i> Cromwell;
This he most happily excuses, by starting at once, and
<i>arranging</i> along with them, the Remark, that <i>Poets have
always excell'd upon Fiction</i>; whereby he unexpectedly
exhibits his <i>more excellent</i> Verses to <i>Cromwell,</i> as
a plain <i>Elucidation</i> of the <i>ficti<span class =
"pagenum">8</span>tious</i> Glory of the Protector; And intimates
at the same time, that the <i>Inferiority</i> of his present
Performance was a natural <i>Illustration</i> of his Majesty's
<i>real</i> Glory;--Never was a deep Reproach averted by a more
happy Reply; which comprehends both the highest Compliment to his
Majesty, and a very firm poetical Excuse of the different
Performances.</p>
<br>
<p align = "center">4.</p>
<p><i>Leonidas</i> the <i>Spartan</i> General, when he advanced
near the <i>Persian</i> Army, was told by one of his own
Captains, that <i>their Enemies were so numerous, it was
impossible to see the Sun for the Multitude of their Arrows</i>;
To which he gallantly reply'd, <i>We shall then have the Pleasure
of fighting in the Shade</i>.</p>

<p>The vast Cope of <i>Persian</i> Arrows is here the
<i>original</i> Subject; which instead of being observed by
<i>Leonidas</i> with Terror, presents to his Fancy the pleasant
Idea of a cool <i>Canopy</i>. There is an <i>Agreement</i> and
Affinity between the two Objects, in regard to the <i>Shelter
from the Sun,</i> which is at once obvious, and
<i>unexpected</i>; And the Cloud of the Enemies Arrows is thus
gaily <i>elucidated,</i> by the <i>Arrangement</i> and Comparison
of it with so desirable an Object as <i>shady Covering</i>.</p>

<p>This Saying of the <i>Spartan</i> General has been handed
through many Ages to the present Time; But the chief Part of the
Pleasure it gives us, results not so much from the
<span class = "folionum">C</span>
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> it contains, as from
the <i>Gallantry,</i> and <i>chearful Spirit,</i> discover'd in
Danger, by <i>Leonidas</i>.</p>
<br>
<p align = "center">5.</p>
<p>An Instance of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> in
the <i>Opposition,</i> I remember to have read somewhere in the
<i>Spectators</i>; where Sir <i>Roger de Coverley</i> intimating
the Splendor which the perverse Widow should have appear'd in, if
she had commenced Lady <i>Coverley,</i> says:</p>

<p><i>That he would have given her a</i> Coalpit <i>to have kept
her in</i> clean Linnen: <i>And that her Finger should have</i>
sparkled <i>with one hundred of his richest</i> Acres.</p>

<p>The joint Introduction of these <i>opposite</i> Objects, as a
<i>Coalpit</i> with <i>clean Linnen,</i> and <i>dirty Acres</i>
with the <i>Lustre</i> of a <i>Jewel,</i> is <i>just</i> in this
Instance, as they really produce each other in their
Consequences; The <i>natural Opposition</i> between them, which
is strongly <i>elucidated</i> by their <i>Arrangement</i>
together, and at the same time their <i>unexpected Connexion</i>
in their Consequences, strike us with a <i>Surprize,</i> which
exhibits the <i>Brilliancy</i> and <i>Sparkling</i> of <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>.</p>

<p>There is also in this Instance, besides the <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, a Spirit of <i>Generosity,</i> and
<i>Magnificence,</i> discover'd by Sir <i>Roger,</i> from the
known Value of a <i>Coalpit,</i> and of so many rich
<i>Acres</i>.</p>

<p>This Kind of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>,
resulting from the sudden <i>Arrangement</i> together of two
<i>opposite</i> Objects, is rarer, than that which is obtained
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
from two <i>similar</i> Objects; It abounds with a high
<i>Surprize,</i> and <i>Brilliancy</i>; and also strongly
<i>elucidates</i> the <i>original</i> Object, from the
<i>Contrast</i> presented between <i>this,</i> and the
<i>auxiliary</i> one; In the same manner as <i>White</i> is more
clearly set <i>off,</i> by being arranged with <i>Black</i>.</p>

<p>It may be proper to observe, that <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, besides being struck out by
<i>just,</i> and <i>direct</i> Introductions of <i>auxiliary</i>
Subjects, is also sometimes obtain'd by <i>Transitions</i> from
one Subject to another, by the Help of an <i>equivocal Word</i>;
which like a <i>Bridge,</i> with two Roads meeting at the End of
it, leads to two different Places. <i>Transitions,</i> thus made
from the right Course, have indeed the Pretence of being
<i>natural</i>; but they ought always to lead us to something
<i>brilliant</i> or poignant, in order to justify their
<i>Deviation</i>; and not to end only at a ridiculous <span class
= "essaysmallcaps">Pun</span>, void of all Spirit and
Poignancy.</p>

<p>The <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, in such
Instances, results, as in all others, from the quick
<i>Arrangement</i> together of two Subjects; But that, which was
first intended for the <i>original</i> one, is dropped; And a new
<i>original</i> Subject is started, through the <i>double
Meaning</i> of a Word, and suddenly <i>enlighten'd</i>.</p>

<p>To give a <i>trite</i> Instance of this kind of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>.</p>

<p>A <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Peer</span> coming out of the
House of Lords, and wanting his Servant, called out, <i>Where's
my Fellow?</i> To which another <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Peer</span>, who stood by him, returned,
<i>Faith, my Lord, not in</i> England.</p>

<span class = "folionum">C2</span>
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<p>A Transition is here unexpededly made from the Sense intended
in the Question to another Point, through the double Meaning of
the word <i>Fellow</i>; it being obvious, that his Lordship's
<i>Servant</i> is the Sense of the Word in the Question; and what
Person is <i>like</i> to his Lordship, the Construction put upon
it in the Answer: Thus a new <i>original</i> Subject is started,
and being suddenly <i>arranged</i> with all that appear
<i>similar</i> to it, is <i>enlighten'd</i> thereby, being found
to have no <i>equal</i> in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>However, though <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> may
be <i>thus</i> struck out, and also appears in the
<i>Contrast</i> with great <i>Brilliancy,</i> yet the highest and
most perfect Instances of it result from the sudden and <i>direct
Arrangement</i> together of two Objects, which hold a perspicuous
and splendid <i>Agreement</i> with each other; It is then adorn'd
with the Charms of <i>Propriety,</i> <i>Clearness</i> and
<i>Illustration</i>; It dispels the Darkness around an Object,
and presents it diftinctly and perfectly to our View; chearing us
with its <i>Lustre,</i> and at the same time informing us with
its <i>Light</i>.</p>

<p>Thus, a Gentleman was observing, that <i>there was</i>
somewhat <i>extremely pleasing in an excellent</i> Understanding,
<i>when it appeared in a beautiful</i> Person; To which another
returned, <i>It is like a fine</i> Jewel <i>well set</i>; You are
here pleased with the Happiness, Propriety, and Splendor of this
<i>new</i> Object, which finely
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<i>elucidates</i> the original Sentiment;--In short, it is the
Excellence of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, <i>to
present the</i> first Image <i>again to your mind, with new
unexpected</i> Clearness <i>and</i> Advantage.</p>

<p>It is also proper to add, that there may be <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> in a <i>Picture,</i>
<i>Landscape,</i> or in any <i>Prospect,</i> where a gay
unexpected <i>Assemblage</i> of <i>similar,</i> or
<i>opposite</i> Objects, is presented.</p>

<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Judgment</span>, <i>is the
Faculty of discerning the various</i> Dimensions, <i>and</i>
Differences, <i>of Subjects</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Invention</span> <i>is the
Faculty of finding out new</i> Assortments, <i>and</i>
Combinations, <i>of</i> Ideas.</p>

<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> <i>is any</i>
whimsical Oddity <i>or</i> Foible, <i>appearing in the</i> Temper
<i>or</i> Conduct <i>of a</i> Person <i>in</i> real Life.</p>

<p>This <i>whimsical Oddity</i> of Conduct, which generally
arises from the strange <i>Cast,</i> or <i>Turn</i> of Mind of a
<i>queer</i> Person, may also result from <i>accidental</i>
Mistakes and Embarrassments between other Persons; who being
misled by a wrong Information and Suspicion in regard to a
Circumstance, shall act towards each other upon this Occasion, in
the same <i>odd whimsical</i> manner, as <i>queer</i>
Persons.</p>

<p>If a <i>Person</i> in real Life, discovers any odd and
remarkable <i>Features</i> of Temper or Conduct, I call such a
Person in the <i>Book</i> of <i>Mankind,</i> a <i>Character</i>.
So that the chief Subjects of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> are Persons in real Life, who are
<i>Characters</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<p>It is easy to be perceived, that <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> are extremely different.</p>

<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> appears only in
the <i>Foibles</i> and <i>whimsical Conduct</i> of <i>Persons</i>
in real Life; <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> appears
in <i>Comparisons,</i> either between <i>Persons</i> in real
Life, or between <i>other Subjects</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> is the
<i>whimsical Oddity,</i> or <i>Foible,</i> which fairly appears
in its Subject, of itself; whereas <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, is the <i>Lustre</i> which is thrown
upon <i>one</i> Subject, by the <i>sudden Introduction</i> of
another Subject.</p>

<p>To constitute <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>,
there need be no more than <i>one</i> Object concern'd, and this
must be always some <i>Person</i> in <i>real Life</i>;--whereas
to produce <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, there must
be always <i>two</i> Objects <i>arranged</i> together, and either
or both of these may be <i>inanimate</i>.</p>

<p>However, though <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>
and <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> are thus absolutely
different in themselves, yet we frequently see them blended
together.</p>

<p>Thus if any <i>Foible</i> of a <i>Character</i> in real Life
is <i>directly</i> attacked, by pointing out the unexpected and
ridiculous <i>Affinity</i> it bears to some <i>inanimate</i>
Circumstances, this Foible is then ridiculed with <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, from the <i>Comparison</i> which is
made.--At the same time, as the <i>whimsical Oddity</i> of a
<i>Character</i> in real Life is the <i>Ground</i> of the whole,
there is also <i>Humour</i> contain'd in the Attack.</p>

<p>If instead of referring the <i>Foible</i> of a Person to any
<i>inanimate</i> Circumstance, the <i>Al<span class =
"pagenum">14</span>lusion</i> had been made to any other
ridiculous <i>Person</i> in <i>real Life</i>; As a <i>conceited
Fellow,</i> perpetually recommending his own Whims, to a
<i>Quack-Doctor</i>;--This <i>Foible</i> will then be ridiculed
with <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>; which is
likewise the original <i>Ground</i>: At the same Time, from the
<i>Comparison</i> which is made, there is apparently <span class
= "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> in the Description.</p>

<p>So that where-ever the <i>Foible</i> of a <i>Character</i> in
real Life is concern'd, there <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> comes in; and wherever a sprightly
unexpected <i>Arrangement</i> is presented of two <i>similar,</i>
or <i>opposite</i> Subjects, whether animate or inanimate, there
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> is exhibited.</p>

<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, as they may thus both be united in
the same Subject, may also separately appear without the least
Mixture together; that is, there may be <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> without <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> without <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>.</p>

<p>Thus, if in order to expose the <i>Foible</i> of a
<i>Character,</i> a <i>real Person</i> is introduc'd, abounding
in this <i>Foible,</i> gravely persisting in it, and valuing
himself upon the Merit of it, with great Self-sufficiency, and
Disdain of others; this <i>Foible</i> is then solely ridiculed
with <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>.</p>

<p>Again, if a gay unexpected <i>Allusion</i> is made from one
<i>inanimate</i> Object to another, or from one <i>Person</i>
in <i>real</i> Life to another, without any Reference to their
whimsical <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads 'Oddistie'">
<i>Oddities</i></ins> or <i>Foibles</i>; there <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> only appears.--Various Instances of
which,
independent of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, have
been
already exhibited.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<p>A <i>Man</i> of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> is
<i>he, who is happy in</i> elucidating <i>any Subject,</i> by a
just and unexpected Arrangement <i>and</i> Comparison <i>of it
with another Subject</i>.</p>

<p>It may be also proper to describe a <i>Man</i> of <span class
= "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, and an <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humourist</span>, which are very different
Persons.</p>

<p>A <i>Man</i> of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>
is <i>one, who can happily exhibit a weak and ridiculous</i>
Character <i>in real Life, either by assuming it himself, or
representing another in it, so naturally, that the</i> whimsical
Oddities, <i>and</i> Foibles, <i>of that</i> Character, <i>shall
be palpably expos'd</i>.</p>

<p>Whereas an <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humourist</span>
<i>is a</i> Person <i>in real Life, obstinately attached to
sensible peculiar</i> Oddities <i>of his own genuine Growth,
which appear in his Temper and Conduct</i>.</p>

<p>In short, a <i>Man</i> of <i>Humour</i> is one, who can
happily exhibit and expose the Oddities and Foibles of an
<i>Humourist,</i> or of other <i>Characters</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Features</i> of an <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humourist</span> being very remarkable and
singular, seem justly to deserve an explicit Description. It is
then to be observ'd, that an <i>Humourist,</i> at the same time
that he is guided in his Manners and Actions by his own genuine
original Fancy and Temper, disdains all <i>Ostentation</i>;
excepting that alone of his <i>Freedom</i> and
<i>Independency,</i> which he is forward of shewing upon every
Occasion, without Ceremony; he is quite superior to the
<i>Affectation</i> of a Virtue or Accomplishment, <span class =
"pagenum">16</span>which he thinks does not belong to him; scorns
all <i>Imitation</i> of others; and contemns the rest of the
World for being servilely obedient to Forms and Customs;
disclaiming all such Submission himself, and regulating his
Conduct in general by his own <i>Conviction</i>,</p>

<p>The <i>Humourist</i> is forward upon many Occasions to deliver
his Opinion, in a peremptory Manner, and before he is desir'd;
but he gives it sincerely, unbiass'd by <i>Fear</i> or
<i>Regard,</i> and then leaves it to the Persons concern'd to
determine for themselves; For he is more pleas'd in the Bottom to
find his Opinion <i>slighted,</i> and to see the Conduct of
others agreeable to that System of Folly and Weakness, which he
has established with himself, to be the Course of their Actions.-
-To view a rational Conduct, even in pursuance of his own Advice,
would greatly disappoint him; and be a Contradiction to this
<i>System</i> he has laid down;--Besides it would deprive him of
an Occasion of gratifying his Spleen, with the Contempt of that
Folly, which he esteems to be natural to the rest of Mankind; For
he considers himself in the World, like a <i>sober</i> Person in
the Company of Men, who are <i>drunken</i> or <i>mad</i>; He may
advise them to be calm, and to avoid hurting themselves, but he
does not expect they will regard his Advice; On the contrary, he
is more pleas'd with observing their <i>Freaks</i> and
<i>Extravagancies</i>.--It is from hence that he discourages and
<span class = "folionum">D</span>
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
depreciates all who pretend to <i>Discretion</i>; Persons of this
Temper not yielding him Sport or Diversion.</p>

<p>It is certain that the <i>Humourist</i> is excessively
<i>proud,</i> and yet without knowing or suspecting it. For from
the Liberty which he frankly allows to others, of rejecting his
Opinion, he is fully persuaded, that he is free from all
<i>Pride</i>; But tho' he acts in this Circumstance without over-
bearing, it has already appear'd, not to be the Effect of his
<i>Humility,</i> but of a different Motive; a Pleasure which he
takes in observing the Extravagancies of others, rather than
their Discretion. But to demonstrate his <i>Pride,</i> besides
the peremptory Manner in which he delivers his Opinion, and
conducts himself upon every Occasion, without any Deference to
others, there is this Circumstance against him; that he is the
most stung by a Defeat, upon any Topic, of all Men living; And
although he disregards Accusations of Roughness and Oddity, and
rather esteems them to be meritorious; yet he will never admit,
that he has been fairly overthrown in a Debate.</p>

<p>It is odd to observe how the <i>Humourist</i> is affected by
<i>contemptuous</i> Treatment. An Insult of this Sort, which
justly excites the <i>Resentment</i> of others, <i>terrifies</i>
him: It sets him upon <i>suspecting</i> himself, and upon
doubting whether he be really that Person of superior Sense to
the rest of the World, which he has <span class =
"pagenum">18</span>long fancied. The Apprehension, that he
actually deserves the Contempt which is put upon him, and that he
is no more than one of the common Herd, almost distracts him; And
instead of violently depreciating, or attacking again, the Person
who has contemn'd him, he will incessantly court his Favour and
good Opinion, as a Cordial he wants, though without seeming to do
so. This is a very extraordinary Weakness, and such as the
<i>Humourist</i> would be infinitely uneasy to find ever
observ'd.</p>

<p>The <i>Humourist,</i> though he quickly espies, and contemns
the <i>Contradictions</i> of others, is yet wilfully attach'd to
several himself, which he will sometimes persue through a long
Course of his own Mortification.--It may be often observ'd, that
he will avoid the Company he likes, for fear they should think he
needs their Support.--At the same time, if he happens to fall
into Company, which he tallies not with, instead of avoiding this
Company, he will continually haunt them: For he is anxious, lest
any Imputation of a Defeat should stand out against him, and
extremely sollicitous to wipe it away; Besides, he cannot endure
it should be thought that he is driven from the Pit.--Thus, in
the first Instance, his <i>Pride</i> shall persuade him to
neglect the Company he likes; and shall force him, in the last,
to follow the Company he hates and despises.</p>

<span class = "folionum">D2</span>
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<p>It is also observable that the <i>Humourist,</i> though he
makes it his Point to regulate his Conduct only by his own
Conviction, will sometimes run counter to it, merely from his
Disdain of all <i>Imitation</i>. Thus he will persist in a wrong
Course, which he knows to be such, and refuse his Compliance with
an Amendment offer'd by others, rather than endure the Appearance
of being an <i>Imitator</i>. This is a <i>narrow</i> Side of the
<i>Humourist</i>; and whenever he is turn'd upon it, he feels
great Uneasiness himself. It strikes a durable Pain into his
Breast, like the constant gnawing of a Worm; and is one
considerable Source of that Stream of Peevishnesss incident to
<i>Humourists</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the same Principle of scorning all <i>Imitation,</i> the
<i>Humourist</i> seldom heartily assents to any speculative
Opinion, which is deliver'd by another; for he is above being
inform'd or set right in his Judgment by any Person, even by a
Brother <i>Humourist</i>. If two of this <i>Cast</i> happen to
meet, instead of uniting together, they are afraid of each other;
and you shall observe <i>one,</i> in order to court the good
Opinion of the <i>other,</i> produce a Specimen of his own
Perfection as an <i>Humourist</i>; by exhibiting some unusual
Strain of <i>sensible Oddity,</i> or by unexpectedly biting a
poor <i>Insipid</i>; which the other <i>Humourist</i> shall
answer again in the same manner, in order to display <i>his</i>
Talents.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<p>These are the <i>Foibles</i> and <i>narrow</i> Whims of a
perfect <i>Humourist</i>. But, on the other hand, he stands upon
a very enlarged Basis; Is a Lover of Reason and Liberty; and
scorns to flatter or betray; nor will he falsify his Principles,
to court the Favour of the Great. He is not credulous, or fond of
Religious or Philosophical Creeds or Creed-makers; But then he
never offers himself to forge Articles of Faith for the rest of
the World. Abounding in poignant and just Reflections; The
Guardian of Freedom, and Scourge of such as do wrong. It is
<i>He</i> checks the Frauds, and curbs the Usurpations of every
Profession. The venal Biass of the assuming Judge, the cruel
Pride of the starch'd Priest, the empty Froth of the florid
Counsellor, the false Importance of the formal Man of Business,
the specious Jargon of the grave Physician, and the creeping
Taste of the trifling Connoisseur, are all bare to his Eye, and
feel the Lash of his Censure; It is <i>He</i> that watches the
daring Strides, and secret Mines of the ambitious Prince, and
desperate Minister: <i>He</i> gives the Alarm, and prevents their
Mischief. Others there are who have Sense and Foresight; but
<i>they</i> are brib'd by Hopes or Fears, or bound by softer
Ties; It is <i>He</i> only, the <i>Humourist,</i> that has the
Courage and Honesty to cry out, unmov'd by personal Resentment:
He flourishes only in a Land of <i>Freedom,</i> and when
<i>that</i> ceases he dies too,
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
the last and noblest <i>Weed</i> of the Soil of
<i>Liberty</i>.</p>

<p>It is a palpable <i>Absurdity</i> to suppose a Person an
<i>Humourist,</i> without excellent Sense and Abilities; as much
as to suppose a <i>Smith</i> in his full Business, without his
<i>Hammers</i> or <i>Forge</i>.--But the <i>Humourist,</i> as he
advances in Years, is apt to grow intolerable to himself and the
World; becoming at length, uneasy, and fatigued with the constant
View of the same Follies; like a Person who is tir'd with seeing
the same Tragi-Comedy continually acted. This sowres his Temper;
And unless some favorable Incidents happen to mellow him, he
resigns himself wholly to Peevishness.--By which Time he
perceives that the World is quite tir'd of <i>him</i>.--After
which he drags on the Remainder of his Life, in a State of
<i>War</i> with the rest of Mankind.</p>

<p>The <i>Humourist</i> is constitutionally, and also from
Reflection, a Man of <i>Sincerity</i>.--If he is a <i>Rogue</i>
upon any Occasion, he is more wilfully one, and puts greater
Violence upon himself in being such, than the rest of the World;
And though he may generally seem to have little
<i>Benevolence,</i> which is the common  Objection against him,
it is only for want of proper Objects; for no Person has
certainly a quicker <i>Feeling</i>; And there are Instances
frequent, of greater Generosity and humane Warmth flowing from an
<i>Humourist,</i> than are capable of proceeding from a weak
<i>Insipid,</i>
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
who labours under a continual Flux of Civility.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the <i>Humourist</i> is perhaps the least of
all others, a <i>despicable</i> Character. But Imitations, which
are frequently seen of this Character, are excessively
despicable.--What can be more ridiculous, than a Wretch setting
up for an <i>Humourist,</i> merely upon the Strength of
disrelishing every Thing, without any Principle;--The Servants,
Drawers, Victuals, Weather,--and growling without Poignancy of
Sense, at every new Circumstance which appears, in public or
private. A perfect and compleat <i>Humourist</i> is rarely to be
found; and when you hear his <i>Voice,</i> is a different
Creature.--In writing to <i>Englishmen,</i> who are generally
tinged, deeply or slightly, with the <i>Dye</i> of the
<i>Humourist,</i> it seem'd not improper to insist the longer
upon this Character; However, let none be too fond of it; For
though an <i>Humourist</i> with his Roughness is greatly to be
preferr'd to a smooth <i>Insipid,</i> yet the Extremes of both
are equally wretched: <i>Ideots</i> being only the lowest Scale
of <i>Insipids,</i> as <i>Madmen</i> are no other than
<i>Humourists</i> in Excess.</p>

<p>It may be proper to observe in this place, that though all
<i>Ostentation,</i> <i>Affectation,</i> and <i>Imitation</i> are
excluded from the Composition of a perfect <i>Humourist</i>; yet
as they are the obvious <i>Foibles</i> of some Persons in Life,
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
they may justly be made the Subject of <i>Humour</i>.</p>

<p>For <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> extensively
and fully understood, is <i>any remarkable</i> Oddity <i>or</i>
Foible <i>belonging to a</i> Person <i>in</i> real Life;
<i>whether this</i> Foible <i>be constitutional, habitual,</i> or
<i>only affected; whether partial in one or two Circumstances; or
tinging the whole Temper and Conduct of the</i> Person.</p>

<p>It has from hence been observ'd, that there is more <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> in the <i>English</i>
Comedies than in others; as we have more various odd
<i>Characters</i> in real Life, than any other Nation, or perhaps
than all other Nations together.</p>

<p>That <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> gives more
Delight, and leaves a more pleasurable Impression behind it, than
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, is universally felt
and established; Though the Reasons for this have not yet been
assign'd.--I shall therefore beg Leave to submit the
following.</p>

<p>1. <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> is more
<i>interesting</i> than <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>
in general, as the <i>Oddities</i> and <i>Foibles</i> of
<i>Persons</i> in <i>real Life</i> are more apt to affect our
Passions, than any Oppositions or Relations between
<i>inanimate</i> Objects.</p>

<p>2. <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> is
<i>Nature,</i> or what really appears in the Subject, without any
Embellishments; <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> only a
Stroke of <i>Art,</i> where the original Subject, being
insufficient of itself, is garnished and deck'd with auxiliary
Objects.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<p>3. <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, or the Foible
of a <i>Character</i> in real Life, is usually insisted upon for
some Length of Time. From whence, and from the common Knowledge
of the Character, it is universally felt and understood.--Whereas
the Strokes of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span> are like
sudden <i>Flashes,</i> vanishing in an Instant, and usually
flying too fast to be sufficiently marked and pursued by the
Audience.</p>

<p>4. <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, if the
Representation of it be just, is compleat and perfect in its
Kind, and entirely fair and unstrain'd.--Whereas in the Allusions
of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, the Affinity is
generally imperfect and defective in one Part or other; and even
in those Points where the Affinity may be allow'd to subsist,
some Nicety and Strain is usually requir'd to make it appear.</p>

<p>5. <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> generally
appears in such Foibles, as each of the Company thinks himself
superior to.--Whereas <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>
shews the Quickness and Abilities of the Person who discovers it,
and places him superior to the rest of the Company.</p>

<p>6. Humour, in the Representation of the <i>Foibles</i> of
<i>Persons</i> in <i>real Life,</i> frequently exhibits very
<i>generous benevolent</i> Sentiments of Heart; And these, tho'
exerted in a particular odd Manner, justly command our Fondness
and Love.--Whereas in the Allusions of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, <i>Severity,</i> <i>Bitterness,</i>
and <i>Satire,</i> are frequently exhibited.--And where these are
avoided,
<span class = "folionum">E</span>
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
not worthy amiable Sentiments of the <i>Heart</i>, but quick
unexpected Efforts of the <i>Fancy,</i> are presented.</p>

<p>7. The odd Adventures, and Embarrassments, which
<i>Persons</i> in <i>real Life</i> are drawn into by their
<i>Foibles,</i> are fit Subjects of <i>Mirth</i>.--Whereas in
pure <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, the Allusions are
rather <i>surprizing,</i> than <i>mirthful</i>; and the
<i>Agreements</i> or <i>Contrasts</i> which are started between
Objects, without any relation to the <i>Foibles</i> of
<i>Persons</i> in real Life, are more fit to be <i>admired</i>
for their <i>Happiness</i> and <i>Propriety,</i> than to excite
our <i>Laughter</i>.--Besides, <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>, in the frequent Repetition of it,
tires the Imagination with its precipitate Sallies and Flights;
and teizes the Judgment.--Whereas <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span>, in the Representation of it, puts
no Fatigue upon the <i>Imagination,</i> and gives exquisite
Pleasure to the <i>Judgment</i>.</p>

<p>These seem to me to be the different Powers and Effects of
<span class = "essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>. However, the most agreeable
Representations or Competitions of all others, appear not where
they <i>separately</i> exist, but where they are <i>united</i>
together in the same Fabric; where <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Humour</span> is the <i>Ground-work</i> and
chief Substance, and <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Wit</span>
happily spread, <i>quickens</i> the whole with
Embellishments.</p>

<p>This is the Excellency of the <i>Character</i> of Sir <i>John
Falstaff</i>; the <i>Ground-work</i> is <i>Humour,</i> the
Representation and Detection of a bragging and vaunting
<i>Coward</i> in <i>real Life</i>;
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
However, this alone would only have expos'd the <i>Knight,</i> as
a meer <i>Noll Bluff,</i> to the Derision of the Company; And
after they had once been gratify'd with his Chastisement, he
would have sunk into Infamy, and become quite odious and
intolerable: But here the inimitable <i>Wit</i> of Sir
<i>John</i> comes in to his Support, and gives a new <i>Rise</i>
and <i>Lustre</i> to his Character; For the sake of his
<i>Wit</i> you forgive his <i>Cowardice</i>; or rather, are fond
of his <i>Cowardice</i> for the Occasions it gives to his
<i>Wit</i>. In short, the <i>Humour</i> furnishes a Subject and
Spur to the <i>Wit,</i> and the <i>Wit</i> again supports and
embellishes the <i>Humour</i>.</p>

<p>At the <i>first</i> Entrance of the <i>Knight,</i> your good
Humour and Tendency to <i>Mirth</i> are irresistibly excited by
his jolly Appearance and Corpulency; you feel and acknowledge
him, to be the fittest Subject imaginable for yielding
<i>Diversion</i> and <i>Merriment</i>; but when you see him
immediately set up for <i>Enterprize</i> and <i>Activity,</i>
with his evident <i>Weight</i> and <i>Unweildiness,</i> your
Attention is all call'd forth, and you are eager to watch him to
the End of his Adventures; Your Imagination pointing out with a
full Scope his future Embarrassments. All the while as you
accompany him forwards, he <i>heightens</i> your Relish for his
future Disasters, by his happy Opinion of his own Sufficiency,
and the gay Vaunts which he makes of his Talents and
Accomplishments;  so that at last when he falls into
<span class = "folionum">E2</span>
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
a Scrape, your Expectation is exquisitely gratify'd, and you have
the full Pleasure of seeing all his trumpeted Honour laid in the
Dust. When in the midst of his Misfortunes, instead of being
utterly demolish'd and sunk, he rises again by the superior Force
of his <i>Wit,</i> and begins a <i>new</i> Course with fresh
Spirit and Alacrity; This excites you the more to <i>renew</i>
the Chace, in full View of his <i>second</i> Defeat; out of which
he recovers again, and triumphs with new Pretensions and
Boastings. After this he immediately starts upon a <i>third</i>
Race, and so on; continually detected and caught, and yet
constantly extricating himself by his inimitable <i>Wit</i> and
<i>Invention</i>; thus yielding a perpetual <i>Round</i> of Sport
and Diversion.</p>

<p>Again, the genteel <i>Quality</i> of Sir <i>John</i> is of
great Use in supporting his Character; It prevents his
<i>sinking</i> too low after several of his Misfortunes; Besides,
you allow him, in consequence of his <i>Rank</i> and
<i>Seniority,</i> the Privilege to dictate, and take the Lead,
and to rebuke others upon many Occasions; By this he is sav'd
from appearing too <i>nauseous</i> and <i>impudent</i>. The good
<i>Sense</i> which he possesses comes also to his Aid, and saves
him from being <i>despicable,</i> by forcing your Esteem for his
real Abilities.--Again, the <i>Privilege</i> you allow him of
rebuking and checking others, when he assumes it with proper
Firmness and Superiority, helps to <i>settle</i> <span class =
"pagenum">28</span>anew, and <i>compose</i> his Character after
an Embarrassment; And reduces in some measure the <i>Spirit</i>
of the Company to a proper <i>Level,</i> before he sets out again
upon a fresh Adventure;--without this, they would be kept
continually <i>strain'd,</i> and <i>wound up</i> to the highest
Pitch, without sufficient Relief and Diversity.</p>

<p>It may also deserve to be remark'd of <i>Falstaff,</i> that
the <i>Figure</i> of his <i>Person</i> is admirably suited to the
<i>Turn</i> of his <i>Mind</i>; so that there arises before you a
perpetual <i>Allusion</i> from one to the other, which forms an
incessant Series of <i>Wit,</i> whether they are in
<i>Contrast</i> or <i>Agreement</i> together.--When he pretends
to <i>Activity,</i> there is <i>Wit</i> in the <i>Contrast</i>
between his <i>Mind</i> and his <i>Person,</i>--And <i>Wit</i> in
their <i>Agreement,</i> when he triumphs in <i>Jollity</i>.</p>

<p>To compleat the whole,--you have in this Character of
<i>Falstaff,</i> not only a free Course of <i>Humour,</i>
supported and embellish'd with admirable <i>Wit</i>; but this
<i>Humour</i> is of a Species the most <i>jovial</i> and
<i>gay</i> in all Nature.--Sir <i>Jobn Falstaff</i> possesses
Generosity, Chearfulness, Alacrity, Invention, Frolic and Fancy
superior to all other Men;--The <i>Figure</i> of his
<i>Person</i> is the Picture of Jollity, Mirth, and Good-nature,
and banishes at once all other Ideas from your Breast; He is
happy himself, and makes you happy.--If you examine him further,
he has no Fierceness, Reserve, Malice or Peevishness lurking in
his
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
Heart; His Intentions are all pointed at innocent Riot and
Merriment; Nor has the Knight any inveterate Design, except
against <i>Sack,</i> and that too he <i>loves</i>.--If, besides
this, he desires to pass for a Man of <i>Activity</i> and
<i>Valour,</i> you can easily excuse so harmless a <i>Foible,</i>
which yields you the highest Pleasure in its constant
<i>Detection</i>.</p>

<p>If you put all these together, it is impossible to <i>hate</i>
honest <i>Jack Falstaff</i>; If you observe them again, it is
impossible to avoid <i>loving</i> him; He is the gay, the witty,
the frolicksome, happy, and fat <i>Jack Falstaff,</i> the most
delightful <i>Swaggerer</i> in all Nature.--You must <i>love</i>
him for your <i>own</i> sake,--At the same time you cannot but
<i>love</i> him for <i>his own</i> Talents; And when you have
<i>enjoy'd</i> them, you cannot but <i>love</i> him in
<i>Gratitude</i>;--He has nothing to disgust you, and every thing
to give you Joy;--His <i>Sense</i> and his <i>Foibles</i> are
equally directed to advance your Pleasure; And it is impossible
to be tired or unhappy in his Company.</p>

<p>This <i>jovial</i> and <i>gay</i> Humour, without any thing
<i>envious,</i> <i>malicious,</i> <i>mischievous,</i> or
<i>despicable,</i> and continually <i>quicken'd</i> and adorn'd
with <i>Wit,</i> yields that peculiar Delight, without any
<i>Alloy,</i> which we all feel and acknowledge in
<i>Falstaff</i>'s Company.--<i>Ben Johnson</i> has <i>Humour</i>
in his <i>Characters,</i> drawn with the most masterly Skill and
Judgment; In Accuracy, Depth, Propriety, and Truth,
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
he has no <i>Superior</i> or <i>Equal</i> amongst <i>Ancients</i>
or <i>Moderns</i>; But the <i>Characters</i> he exhibits are of
<i>satirical,</i> and <i>deceitful,</i> or of a <i>peevish</i> or
<i>despicable</i> Species; as <i>Volpone,</i> <i>Subtle,</i>
<i>Morose,</i> and <i>Abel Drugger</i>; In all of which there is
something very justly to be <i>hated</i> or <i>despised</i>; And
you feel the same Sentiments of <i>Dislike</i> for every other
<i>Character</i> of <i>Johnson</i>'s; so that after you have been
<i>gratify'd</i> with their <i>Detention</i> and
<i>Punishment,</i> you are quite tired and disgusted with their
Company:--Whereas <i>Shakespear,</i> besides the peculiar
<i>Gaiety</i> in the <i>Humour</i> of <i>Falstaff,</i> has
guarded him from disgusting you with his <i>forward Advances,</i>
by giving him <i>Rank</i> and <i>Quality</i>; from being
<i>despicable</i> by his real good <i>Sense</i> and excellent
<i>Abilities</i>; from being <i>odious</i> by his <i>harmless
Plots</i> and <i>Designs</i>; and from being <i>tiresome</i> by
his inimitable Wit, and his new and incessant <i>Sallies</i> of
highest <i>Fancy</i> and <i>Frolick</i>.</p>

<p>This discovers the <i>Secret</i> of carrying <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Comedy</span> to the highest Pitch of Delight;
Which lies <i>in drawing the Persons exhibited, with such
chearful and amiable</i> Oddities <i>and</i> Foibles, <i>as you
would chuse in your own</i> Companions <i>in</i> real Life;--
otherwise, tho' you may be diverted at first with the
<i>Novelty</i> of a Character, and with a proper <i>Detection</i>
and <i>Ridicule</i> of it, yet its <i>Peevishness,</i>
<i>Meanness,</i> or <i>Immorality,</i> will begin to disgust you
after a little Reflection, and become soon <i>tiresome</i> and
<i>odious</i>;
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
It being certain, that <i>whoever cannot be endured as an</i>
accidental <i>Companion in</i> real Life, <i>will never become,
for the very same Reasons, a</i> favorite comic Character <i>in
the Theatre</i>.</p>

<p>This <i>Relish</i> for <i>generous</i> and <i>worthy</i>
Characters alone, which we all feel upon the <i>Theatre,</i>
where no Biass of Envy, Malice, or personal Resentment draws us
aside, seems to be some Evidence of our <i>natural</i> and
<i>genuin</i> Disposition to <i>Probity</i> and <i>Virtue</i>;
tho' the Minds of most Persons being early and deeply
<i>tinged</i> with vicious Passions, it is no wonder that
<i>Stains</i> have been generally mistaken for <i>original
Colours</i>.</p>

<p>It may be added, that <i>Humour</i> is the most exquisite and
delightful, when the <i>Oddities</i> and <i>Foibles</i>
introduc'd are not <i>mischievous</i> or <i>sneaking,</i> but
<i>free,</i> <i>jocund,</i> and <i>liberal</i>; and such as
result from a generous Flow of Spirits, and a warm universal
<i>Benevolence</i>.</p>

<p>It is obviously from hence, that the <i>Character</i> of Sir
<i>Roger</i> de <i>Coverly</i> in the <i>Spectators</i> is so
extremely agreeable. His <i>Foibles</i> are all derived from some
amiable Cause.--If he believes that <i>one Englishman</i> can
conquer <i>two Frenchmen,</i> you laugh at his <i>Foible,</i> and
are fond of a <i>Weakness</i> in the Knight, which proceeds from
his high Esteem of his <i>own Country-men</i>.--If he chuses you
should employ a <i>Waterman</i> or <i>Porter</i> with <i>one</i>
Leg, you readily excuse the Inconvenience he puts you to, for his
worthy regard to the Suffering of a brave
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<i>Soldier</i>.--In short, though he is guilty of continual
Absurdities, and has little Understanding or real Abilities, you
cannot but <i>love</i> and <i>esteem</i> him, for his
<i>Honour,</i> <i>Hospitality,</i> and universal
<i>Benevolence</i>.</p>

<p>It is indeed true, that his <i>Dignity,</i> <i>Age,</i> and
<i>Rank</i> in his Country, are of constant Service in
<i>upholding</i> his Character. These are a perpetual
<i>Guard</i> to the Knight, and preserve him from <i>Contempt</i>
upon many Occasions.--All which corresponds entirely with the
fore-going <i>Remark</i>. For you would be fond of Sir
<i>Roger's</i> Acquaintaince and Company in <i>real Life,</i> as
he is a Gentleman of <i>Quality</i> and <i>Virtue</i>; You love
and admire him in the <i>Spectators</i> for the <i>same</i>
Reasons; And for these also he would become, if he was rightly
exhibited, a <i>favorite</i> Character in the <i>Theatre</i>.</p>

<p>It may be proper to observe in this Place, that the
<i>Business</i> of <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Comedy</span>
is to exhibit the whimsical <i>unmischievous Oddities,</i>
<i>Frolics,</i> and <i>Foibles</i> of <i>Persons</i> in <i>real
Life</i>; And also to <i>expose</i> and <i>ridicule</i> their
<i>real Follies,</i> <i>Meanness,</i> and <i>Vices</i>. The
<i>former,</i> it appears, is more pleasurable to the Audience,
but the <i>latter</i> has the Merit of being more
instructive.</p>

<p>The <i>Business</i> of <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Tragedy</span> is to exhibit the
<i>Instability</i> of <i>human</i> Grandeur, and the unexpected
<i>Misfortunes</i> and <i>Distresses</i> incident to the
<i>Innocent</i> and <i>Worthy</i> in all Stations.--And also to
shew the terrible Sallies and the miserable
<span class = "folionum">F</span>
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
Issue and Punishment of ungovern'd Passions and Wickedness.--The
<i>former</i> softens the Heart and fills it with Compassion,
Humility and Benevolence.--Compositions of this Sort are the
highest, most admirable, and useful in all Nature, when they are
finish'd with Propriety and Delicacy, and justly wrought up with
the Sublime and Simplicity.--The <i>latter</i> Species of
<i>Tragedy</i> terrifies and shocks us, in exhibiting both the
Crimes and the Punishments. It threatens us into Moderation and
Justice, by shewing the terrible Issue of their Contraries.
Pieces of this Sort, conducted with Propriety, and carrying
Application to ourselves, can scarcely be desireable; But as they
are generally conducted, they amount only to giving us an absurd
Representation of a Murther committed by some furious foaming
<i>Basha,</i> or <i>Sultan</i>.</p>

<p>To return.--<i>Johnson</i> in his <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">comic</span> Scenes has expos'd and ridicul'd
<i>Folly</i> and <i>Vice</i>; <i>Shakespear</i> has usher'd in
<i>Joy,</i> <i>Frolic</i> and <i>Happiness</i>.--The
<i>Alchymist,</i> <i>Volpone</i> and <i>Silent Woman</i> of
<i>Johnson,</i> are most exquisite <i>Satires</i>. The
<i>comic</i> Entertainments of <i>Shakespear</i> are the highest
Compositions of <i>Raillery,</i> <i>Wit</i> and <i>Humour</i>.
<i>Johnson</i> conveys some Lesson in every Character.
<i>Shakespear</i> some new Species of Foible and Oddity. The one
pointed his Satire with masterly Skill; the other was inimitable
in touching the Strings of Delight. With <i>Johnson</i> you are
confin'd and instructed, with <i>Shakespear</i> unbent and
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
dissolv'd in Joy. <i>Johnson</i> excellently concerts his Plots,
and all his Characters unite in the one Design. <i>Shakespear</i>
is superior to such Aid or Restraint; His Characters continually
sallying from one independent Scene to another, and charming you
in each with fresh Wit and Humour.</p>

<p>It may be further remark'd, that <i>Johnson</i> by pursuing
the most useful Intention of <i>Comedy,</i> is in Justice oblig'd
to <i>hunt down</i> and <i>demolish</i> his own Characters. Upon
this Plan he must necessarily expose them to your <i>Hatred,</i>
and of course can never bring out an amiable Person. His
<i>Subtle,</i> and <i>Face</i> are detected at last, and become
mean and despicable. Sir <i>Epicure Mammon</i> is properly
trick'd, and goes off ridiculous and detestable. The <i>Puritan
Elders</i> suffer for their Lust of Money, and are quite nauseous
and abominable; And his <i>Morose</i> meets with a severe
Punishment, after having sufficiently tir'd you with his
Peevishness.--But <i>Shakespear,</i> with happier Insight, always
supports his Characters in your <i>Favour</i>. His Justice
<i>Shallow</i> withdraws before he is tedious; The <i>French</i>
Doctor, and <i>Welch</i> Parson, go off in full Vigour and
Spirit; Ancient <i>Pistoll</i> indeed is scurvily treated;
however, he keeps up his Spirits, and continues to threaten so
well, that you are still desirous of his Company; and it is
impossible to be tir'd or dull with the gay unfading Evergreen
<i>Falstaff</i>.</p>

<span class = "folionum">F2</span>
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<p>But in remarking upon the Characters of <i>Johnson,</i> it
would be unjust to pass <i>Abel Drugger</i> without notice; This
is a little, mean, sneaking, sordid Citizen, hearkening to a
Couple of Sharpers, who promise to make him rich; they can
scarcely prevail upon him to resign the least Tittle he
possesses, though he is assur'd, it is in order to get more; and
your Diversion arises, from seeing him <i>wrung</i> between
<i>Greediness</i> to <i>get</i> Money, and <i>Reluctance</i> to
<i>part</i> with any for that Purpose. His Covetousness
continually prompts him to follow the Conjurer, and puts him at
the same Time upon endeavouring to stop his Fees. All the while
he is excellently managed, and spirited on by <i>Face</i>.
However, this Character upon the whole is <i>mean</i> and
<i>despicable,</i> without any of that free spirituous jocund
Humour abounding in <i>Shakespear</i>. But having been strangely
exhibited upon the Theatre, a few Years ago, with odd Grimaces
and extravagant Gestures, it has been raised into more Attention
than it justly deserved; It is however to be acknowledg'd, that
<i>Abel</i> has no Hatred, Malice or Immorality, nor any assuming
Arrogance, Pertness or Peevishness; And his eager Desire of
getting and saving Money, by Methods he thinks lawful, are
excusable in a Person of his Business; He is therefore not odious
or detestable, but harmless and inoffensive in private Life; and
from thence, correspondent with the Rule already laid down, he is
the
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
most capable of any of <i>Johnson</i>'s Characters, of being a
Favourite on the Theatre.</p>

<p>It appears, that in Imagination, Invention, Jollity and gay
Humour, <i>Johnson</i> had little Power; But <i>Shakespear</i>
unlimited Dominion. The first was cautious and strict, not daring
to sally beyond the Bounds of Regularity. The other bold and
impetuous, rejoicing like a Giant to run his Course, through all
the Mountains and Wilds of Nature and Fancy.</p>

<p>It requires an almost painful Attention to mark the Propriety
and Accuracy of <i>Johnson,</i> and your Satisfaction arises from
Reflection and Comparison; But the Fire and Invention of
<i>Shakespear</i> in an Instant are shot into your Soul, and
enlighten and chear the most indolent Mind with their own Spirit
and Lustre.--Upon the whole, <i>Johnson</i>'s Compositions are
like finished Cabinets, where every Part is wrought up with the
most excellent Skill and Exactness;--<i>Shakespear</i>'s like
magnificent Castles, not perfectly finished or regular, but
adorn'd with such bold and magnificent Designs, as at once
delight and astonish you with their Beauty and Grandeur.</p>
<br>

<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Raillery</span> <i>is a genteel
poignant Attack of a</i> Person <i>upon any</i> slight Foibles,
Oddities, <i>or</i> Embarrassments <i>of his, in which he is
tender, or may be supposed to be tender, and unwilling to come to
a free Explanation.</i></p>

<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Satire</span> <i>is a witty and
severe Attack of</i> mischievous Habits <i>or</i> Vices;</p>

<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Ridicule</span> <i>is a
free</i> Attack <i>of any</i> Motly Composition, <i>wherein a
real or affected</i> Excellence <i>and</i> Defect <i>both jointly
appear,</i> glaring <i>together, and</i> mocking <i>each other,
in the same</i> Subject.</p>

<p>Hence the Aim of <i>Raillery,</i> is to please you, by some
little <i>Embarrassment</i> of a <i>Person</i>; Of <i>Satire,</i>
to scourge <i>Vice,</i> and to deliver it up to your just
<i>Detestation</i>; And of <i>Ridicule,</i> to set an Object in a
mean ludicrous Light, so as to expose it to your <i>Derision</i>
and <i>Contempt</i>.</p>

<p>It appears therefore that <i>Raillery</i> and <i>Ridicule</i>
differ in several Circumstances.</p>

<p>1. <i>Raillery</i> can only be employ'd in relation to
<i>Persons,</i> but <i>Ridicule</i> may be employ'd in what
relates either to <i>Persons,</i> or other <i>Objects</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Raillery</i> is us'd only upon <i>slight</i> Subjects,
where no real Abilities or Merit are questioned, in order to
avoid degrading the Person you attack, or rendering him
contemptible; Whereas <i>Ridicule</i> observes no such Decency,
but endeavours really to degrade the Person attack'd, and to
render him contemptible.</p>

<p>3. <i>Raillery</i> may be pointed at a whimsical Circumstance,
only because a Person is known to be tender upon it; and your
Pleasure will arise from the <i>Embarrassment</i> he suffers, in
being put to an Explanation;--Thus a <span class =
"pagenum">38</span>young Gentleman may be <i>rallied</i> upon his
Passion for a Lady;--At the same Time there may be no Ground for
<i>Ridicule</i> in this Circumstance, as it may no way deserve
your <i>Derision</i> or <i>Contempt</i>.</p>

<p>4. As it thus appears that there are Subjects of
<i>Raillery,</i> into which <i>Ridicule</i> cannot justly be
admitted; So there are Subjects of <i>Ridicule,</i> wherein your
Derision and Contempt are so strongly excited, that they are too
gross for <i>Raillery</i>;--As a person tossed in a Blanket; or
the unfortunate Attack which another has made upon a
Windmill.</p>

<p>5. In short, <i>Raillery,</i> if the Adventures it is turn'd
upon are too <i>gross</i> and <i>luscious,</i> becomes
<i>Ridicule</i>; And therefore, in Comparison together,
<i>Raillery</i> appears like <i>Wine</i> of a thin Body, and
delicate poignant Flavour; <i>Ridicule,</i> like a <i>Wine</i>
which is fuller, and more rich, and luscious.</p>

<p><i>Quixote</i> is a Character, wherein <i>Humour</i> and
<i>Ridicule</i> are finely interwoven;--It is not a Subject of
<i>Satire,</i> as the Knight is free from all Badness of Heart,
and Immorality; Nor properly of <i>Raillery,</i> his Adventures
in general being too <i>gross</i> and <i>disastrous</i>;-- The
<i>Humour</i> appears, in the Representation of a Person in real
Life, fancying himself to be, under the most solemn Obligations
to attempt <i>hardy</i> Atchievements; and upon this Whimsy
immediately pursuing the most romantic Adventures, with great
Gravity, Importance,
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
and Self-sufficiency; To heighten your Mirth, the <i>hardy</i>
Atchievements to be accomplish'd by this Hero, are wittily
contrasted by his own meagre weak Figure, and the <i>desperate
Unfierceness</i> of his Steed <i>Rozinante</i>;--The
<i>Ridicule</i> appears in the strange Absurdity of the Attempts,
upon which the Knight chuses to exercise his Prowess; Its
Poignancy is highly quicken'd, and consequently the Pleasure it
gives you, by his miserable Disasters, and the doleful
Mortifications of all his Importance and Dignity;--But here,
after the Knight, by diverting you in this manner, has brought
himself down to the lowest Mark, he rises again and forces your
Esteem, by his excellent Sense, Learning and Judgment, upon any
Subjects which are not ally'd to his Errantry; These continually
act for the Advancement of his Character; And with such Supports
and Abilities he always obtains your ready Attention, and never
becomes heavy or tedious.</p>

<p>To these you are to add the perfect <i>good Breeding</i> and
<i>Civility</i> of the Knight upon every Occasion; which are some
Kind of Merit in his Favour, and entitle him to Respect, by the
Rules of common Gentility and Decency; At the same time his
Courage, his Honour, Generosity, and Humanity, are conspicuous in
every Act and Attempt; The <i>Foibles</i> which he possesses,
besides giving you exquisite Pleasure, are wholly inspir'd by
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
these worthy Principles; Nor is there any thing base, or
detestable, in all his Temper or Conduct; It was from hence that
the <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Duke</span> and the <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Dutchess</span> were extremely delighted
with his Visit at their <i>Castle</i>; And you yourself, if he
existed in real Life, would be fond of his Company at your own
Table; which proves him, upon the whole, to be an amiable
Character;--It is therefore no wonder that Signior <i>Don <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads 'Quoxote'">Quixote</ins>
of la Mancha</i> has been so courteously receiv'd in every
Country of <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>Thus delightfully wrought, as this History is, with
<i>Humour</i> and <i>Ridicule,</i> yet <i>Cervantes,</i> still
fearful of tiring you with too much of the <i>Errantry,</i> has
introduc'd the most charming Variety of other Adventures; --All
along in the pacific Intervals, you are inform'd of the private
Occurrences between the Knight and his 'Squire; And from these,
where it is least to be expected, you are surpriz'd with the most
high and delicious Repast;-- Nothing can be more pregnant with
Mirth, than the Opposition continually working between the grave
Solemnity and Dignity of <i>Quixote,</i> and the arch Ribaldry
and Meanness of <i>Sancho</i>; And the Contrast can never be
sufficiently admir'd, between the <i>excellent fine Sense</i> of
the <span class = "essaysmallcaps">One</span>, and the
<i>dangerous common Sense</i> of the <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Other</span>.</p>

<p>It is here that the Genius and Power of <i>Cervantes</i> is
most admirably shewn; He was
<span class = "folionum">G</span>
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
the greatest Master that ever appear'd, in finely opposing, and
contrasting his Characters. It is from hence that you feel a
Poignancy and Relish in his Writings, which is not to be met with
in any others; The natural Reflexions and Debates of
<i>Quixote</i> and <i>Sancho</i> would have been barren, insipid,
and trite, under other Management; But <i>Cervantes,</i> by his
excellent Skill in the <i>Contrast,</i> has from these drawn a
Regale, which for high, quick, racy Flavour, and Spirit, has yet
never been equall'd.</p>

<p>It may here be enquir'd, What Species of Composition or
Character is the most pleasurable, and mirthful, in all Nature?--
In <i>Falstaff,</i> you have <i>Humour</i> embelish'd with
<i>Wit</i>; In <i>Quixote,</i> <i>Humour</i> made poignant with
<i>Ridicule</i>; And it is certain that <i>Humour</i> must always
be the Ground-work of such Subjects, no Oddities in inanimate
Objects being capable of interesting our Passions so strongly, as
the Foibles of Persons in real Life;--The chief Substance of
<i>Johnson</i>'s Compositions is <i>Humour</i> and <i>Satire</i>;
upon which Plan, as hath been already observ'd, he is oblig'd to
demolish, and render detestable, his own Characters;--
<i>Humour</i> and <i>Raillery</i> are also capable of furnishing
a Repast of quick Relish and Flavour; In written Compositions,
the Attack of the <i>Raillery,</i> as well as the Reception of
it, may be happily conducted, which in other accidental
Encounters are liable to Hazard; All Peevishness
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
or Offence is thus easily avoided, and the Character attack'd is
sav'd from being really contemptible;--But then indeed the
Pleasure you are to receive generally depends upon the Confusion
of the Person attack'd, without there being in reason a
sufficient Cause for this Confusion;--It is for want of this just
Foundation, that the Pleasure arising  from <i>Raillery</i> is
apt to come forth with less Freedom, Fulness, and Conviction,
though with more Delicacy, than that which is derived from
<i>Wit,</i> or <i>Ridicule</i>;--However, <i>Humour</i> and
<i>Raillery</i> united together, when the <i>Raillery</i> is
founded upon some <i>real</i> Embarrassment in the Circumstance,
as well as in the Confusion of the Person attack'd, will furnish
a very high Entertainment; which has Pretensions to rival either
<i>Humour</i> and <i>Wit,</i> or <i>Humour</i> and
<i>Ridicule</i>.</p>

<p><a name = "horace">To give an Instance</a> of <i>Humour</i>
and <i>Raillery,</i> I shall insert <i>Horace</i>'s famous
Description of his Embarrassment with an impertinent Fellow. This
indeed is entitl'd, in almost all the Editions of <i>Horace,</i>
a <i>Satire,</i> but very improperly, as the Subject is not
<i>Vice</i> or <i>Immorality</i>;</p>

<p>The Intention of <i>Horace</i> in this Piece, is to expose an
<i>impertinent</i> Fellow, and to give a ludicrous Detail of his
own <i>Embarrassment</i>; Your Pleasure arises from the View
which he gives you of his own Mortification, whereby he lays
himself fairly open to your <i>Raillery</i>; <span class =
"pagenum">45</span>This is the more poignant, and quick, from the
real Distress which you see he endur'd, in this odd Attack; At
the same Time the particular Turn of the Fellow, who chose in
this Manner to pin himself upon another, is a very odd Species of
impertinent <i>Humour</i>.--This Piece, as it stands,
irresistibly forces your Mirth, and shakes you with Laughter; But
to a Person of Discernment, it is chiefly at <i>Horace</i>'s
Expence; Who in receiving and enduring such insolent Treatment,
appears in a Light too low and ridiculous, though he has thought
fit himself to exhibit the Scene again for the Diversion of the
Public;</p>

<p>The</p>
<div class = "verse">
&emsp;Misere, cupis, ---- abire,<br>
Jamdudum video, sed nil agis, usque tenebo,<br>
Persequar;--
</div>
<p>was an absolute Insult; And very unfit to be related by the
Person who suffer'd it, as a Matter of Merriment;--Besides this
Tameness of <i>Horace,</i> the Impudence of the Fellow is
excessively nauseous and disgusting at the Bottom, though the
whole carries a Froth of <i>Raillery</i> and <i>Humour</i> upon
the Surface.</p>

<p>The Truth is, that this Piece, as it stands, would have
properly proceeded from another Person, who had intended to
expose the Impertinence and Impudence of the Fellow, and freely
to <i>rally</i> poor <i>Horace,</i> with some Mixture of
<i>Ridicule,</i> upon his unfortunate Embarrassment; upon this
Basis it will ap<span class = "pagenum">46</span>pear with
Propriety; Without which all Compositions of <i>Wit,</i> or
<i>Humour,</i> or <i>Taste,</i> tho' at first they may
pleasurably strike the Fancy or Sight, are at last disgusting to
the Judgment.</p>

<p>Having here occasionally offer'd some Remarks upon this
Composition, as it now stands, it may be proper to point out the
Manner in which the <i>Humour</i> and <i>Raillery</i> of such an
Embarrassment, might have been carried to the highest Pitch; And
the Description of it have been given by <i>Horace</i> himself,
without any Diminution of his own Gentility or Importance;--
Imagine then that he had been join'd in his Walk by a weak,
ignorant Person, of Good-nature, and  the utmost Civility; one
who fancy'd himself possessed of the greatest Talents, and fully
persuaded that he gave all he convers'd with a particular
Pleasure;--Upon such an Attack, no Resentment or Anger could have
been decently shewn by <i>Horace,</i> As the Person thus
pestering him, was all the while intending the highest
Compliment; And must therefore be received, and attended to, with
perfect Complaisance; The <i>Humour</i> of this Person would have
been very entertaining, in the strange Conceit which he held of
his own Abilities, and of the paticular Pleasure he was granting
to <i>Horace,</i> in condescending to give him so much of his
Company; In these Sentiments he should regard all <i>Horace</i>'s
Excuses, Endeavours, and Struggles to be
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
gone, as Expressions of his Sense of the Honour done him; which
should be an Argument with this Person for obstinately persisting
to honour him still further; All the while he must be supported
by some <i>real Importance</i> belonging to him, attended with
<i>good Breeding,</i> and strengthened by such occasional
Instances of <i>Sense,</i> as may secure him from being trampled
upon, or becoming absolutely contemptible; In such an Adventure
the Mortification, and Distress of <i>Horace,</i> would be
excessively whimsical and severe; especially as he would be
depriv'd of all Succour and Relief; being in Decency oblig'd, not
only to suppress all Anger or Uneasiness, but, what is
exquisitely quick, to receive this whole Treatment with the
utmost Complacency; An <i>Embarrassment</i> of this sort, finely
described, would have yielded the greatest Pleasure to the
Reader, and carried the <i>Raillery</i> upon <i>Horace,</i>
without hurting or degrading him, to the highest Degree of
<i>Poignancy</i>;  And from hence may be conceiv'd, what
delightful Entertainments are capable of being drawn from
<i>Humour</i> and <i>Raillery</i>.</p>

<p>It is also easy to apprehend, that the several Subjects of
<i>Wit,</i> <i>Humour,</i> <i>Raillery,</i> <i>Satire,</i> and
<i>Ridicule,</i> appear not only <i>singly</i> upon many
Occasions, or <i>two</i> of them combined together, but are also
frequently united in other Combinations, which are more
<i>complicate</i>; An Instance of the Union together <span class
= "pagenum">48</span>of <i>Humour,</i> <i>Raillery,</i> and
<i>Ridicule,</i> I remember to have read somewhere in
<i>Voiture</i>'s Letters; He is in <i>Spain,</i> and upon the
Point of proceeding from thence to some other Place in an
<i>English</i> Vessel; After he has written this Account of
himself to a Lady at <i>Paris,</i> he proceeds in his Letter to
this Purpose;</p>

<blockquote>"You may perhaps apprehend, that I shall be in some
Danger this Voyage, of falling into the Hands of a <i>Barbary</i>
Corsair; But to relieve you from all such Fears, I shall beg
Leave to tell you, what my honest Captain has inform'd me
himself, for my own Satisfaction; He suspected, it seems, that I
might have some Uneasiness upon this Head; and has therefore
privately assured me, that I have no need to be afraid of being
taken with him; for that whenever  it is likely to come to this,
he will infallibly  blow up the Ship with his own Hands;--After
this, I presume, you will be perfectly easy, that I am in no
Danger of going to <i>Sallee</i>;"
</blockquote>

<p>This is exquisitely <i>rich</i>; The brave and odd Fancy of
the <i>English</i> Captain, in finding out for himself, and
<i>privately</i> communicating to <i>Voiture,</i> this Method of
Security from Slavery, abounds with the highest <i>Humour</i>; At
the same time the honest Tar, as a <i>Projecter,</i> is
excessively open to <i>Ridicule,</i> for his Scheme to blow them
all up, in order to prevent their being taken Prisoners; There is
besides these,
<span class = "folionum">H</span>
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
a very full <i>Raillery,</i> which <i>Voiture</i> here opens upon
<i>himself</i>; For as this Adventure, which he is going to be
engaged in, has been attended, as yet, with no Mischief; nor is
certain to be so, the whole is to be consider'd, at present, as
only a slight Scrape; especially as he exhibits it in this manner
himself, and invites you to make it the Object of your Pleasure,
and <i>Raillery</i>;--It may also be observ'd, that the
<i>Humour</i> in this Subject, which flows from the
<i>Captain,</i> is adorn'd with a very peculiar, and pleasing
<i>Propriety</i>; As it is not barely a <i>Whim,</i> or the
Result of an <i>odd Sourness</i> or <i>queer Pride,</i> but the
Effect of his <i>Courage,</i> and of that Freedom from all Terror
at Death, which is perfectly amiable in his Character.</p>

<p>There are other Combinations of <i>Wit,</i> <i>Humour,</i>
<i>Raillery,</i> <i>Satire,</i> and <i>Ridicule,</i> where
<i>four</i> of them, or all <i>five,</i> are united in one
Subject;--Like various <i>Notes</i> in <i>Music,</i> sounding
together, and jointly composing one exquisite Piece of Harmony;--
Or like different <i>Rays</i> of <i>Light,</i> shining together
in one <i>Rainbow</i>: It is pleasant to <i>divide</i> these
<i>Combinations,</i> and to view as with a <i>Prism,</i> the
different Rays united in each; of which <i>Humour,</i> like the
<i>Red,</i> is eminent for its superior Force and Excellence;--
When  the Judgment is thus capable of parting, and easily
assigning the several Quan<span class =
"pagenum">50</span>tities, and Proportions of each, it heightens
our Pleasure, and gives us an absolute Command over the Subject;
But they are often so intimately mix'd, and blended together,
that it is difficult to separate them clearly, tho' they are all
certainly felt in the same Piece;--Like  the different
<i>Flavours</i> of rich <i>Fruits,</i> which are inseparably
mix'd, yet all perfectly tasted, in one <i>Pine-Apple</i>.</p>

<p><i>Raillery,</i> and <i>Satire,</i> are extremely
different;</p>

<p>1. <i>Raillery,</i> is a genteel poignant Attack of
<i>slight</i> Foibles and Oddities; <i>Satire</i> a witty and
severe Attack of <i>mischievous</i> Habits and Vices.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Intention</i> of <i>Raillery,</i> is to procure your
<i>Pleasure,</i> by exposing the little Embarrassment of a
Person; But the <i>Intention</i> of <i>Satire,</i> is to raise
your <i>Detestation,</i> by exposing the real Deformity of his
Vices.</p>

<p>3. If in <i>Raillery</i> the Sting be given too deep and
severe, it will sink into Malice and Rudeness, And your Pleasure
will not be justifiable; But <i>Satire,</i> the more deep and
severe the Sting of it is, will be the more excellent;  Its
Intention being entirely to root out and destroy the Vice.</p>

<p>4. It is a just Maxim upon these Subjects, that in
<i>Raillery</i> a good-natur'd Esteem ought always to appear,
without any Resentment or Bitterness; In <i>Satire</i> a generous
free Indignation, without any sneaking Fear or
<span class = "folionum">H2</span>
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
Tenderness; It being a sort of partaking in the Guilt to keep any
Terms with Vices.</p>

<p>It is from hence that <i>Juvenal,</i> as a <i>Satirist,</i> is
greatly superior to <i>Horace</i>; But indeed many of the short
Compositions of <i>Horace,</i> which are indiscriminately ranged
together, under the general Name of <i>Satires,</i> are not
properly such, but Pieces of <i>Raillery</i> or
<i>Ridicule</i>.</p>

<p>As <i>Raillery,</i> in order to be decent, can only be
exercised upon <i>slight</i> Misfortunes and Foibles, attended
with no deep Mischief, nor with any Reproach upon real Merit, so
it ought only to be used between <i>Equals</i> and
<i>Intimates</i>; It being evidently a Liberty too great to be
taken by an <i>Inferior</i>; and too inequitable to be taken by a
<i>Superior,</i> as his Rank shields him from any Return.</p>

<p><i>Raillery</i> is the most agreeable, when it is founded on a
<i>slight</i> Embarrassment or Foible, which upon being unfolded,
appears to have arisen from the <i>real Merit,</i> or from the
<i>Excess</i> of any <i>Virtue,</i> in the Person attack'd.</p>

<p>But yet this Embarrassment must always be <i>real,</i> and
attended with the Chagrin or Confusion of the <i>rally'd</i>
Person, or capable of being fairly suppos'd to have been so;
otherwise the Attack will be void of all Poignancy, and Pleasure
to the Company; And evaporate either into <i>indirect
Flattery,</i> or else into the <i>Insipid</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<p>Thus, to attack a <i>fine Lady</i> upon the Enemies  she has
made, by the mischievous Effects of her Beauty, will be properly
genteel indirect <i>Flattery</i>--if it be well conducted,--
otherwise,  the <i>Insipid</i>; But it cannot be deem'd
<i>Raillery</i>; It being impossible to suppose the Lady
<i>really</i> chagrin'd by such an imaginary Misfortune, or
uneasy at any Explanation upon this Subject;</p>

<p><i>Raillery</i> ought soon to be ended; For by long keeping
the Person attack'd, even in a <i>slight</i> Pain, and continuing
to dwell upon his Mis-adventures, you become rude and ill-
natur'd;--Or  if the <i>Raillery</i> be only turn'd upon an
Embarrassment, arising from the Excess of Merit or Abilities, Yet
if it be long confined upon the same Subject, the Person it is
pointed at, will either suspect that your Aim is, to leave some
<i>Impression</i> against him, or else that you are designing him
a tedious dark <i>Compliment</i>; And accordingly he will either
regard you with Hatred or Contempt;--Much  less should a Person,
who introduces himself as a Subject of <i>Raillery,</i> insist
long upon it; For either he will be offensive in engrossing all
Attention to himself; or if the Company are pleas'd, it must be
by his Buffoonery.</p>

<p>The Difference between <i>Satire,</i> and <i>Ridicule,</i> has
been already pointed out;--<i>Satire</i> being always concerned
with the <i>Vices</i> of
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<i>Persons</i>;--Whereas <i>Ridicule</i> is justly employ'd, not
upon the <i>Vices,</i> but the <i>Foibles</i> or
<i>Meannesses</i> of <i>Persons,</i> And also upon the
<i>Improprieties</i> of other Subjects; And is directed, not to
raise your <i>Detestation,</i> but your <i>Derision</i> and
<i>Contempt</i>;--It being evident that <i>Immoralities</i> and
<i>Vice</i> are too <i>detestable</i> for <i>Ridicule,</i> and
are therefore properly the Subject of <i>Satire</i>; Whereas
<i>Foibles</i> and <i>Meannesses</i> are too <i>harmless</i> for
<i>Satire,</i> and deserve only to be treated with
<i>Ridicule</i>.</p>

<p>The usual Artillery of <i>Ridicule</i> is <i>Wit</i>; whereby
the <i>Affinity</i> or <i>Coincidence</i> of any Object with
others, which are absurd and contemptible, is unexpectedly
exhibited;--There is also another, very forcible, Manner in which
<i>Ridicule</i> may act; And that is by employing <i>Humour</i>
alone; Thus the Foible or Queerness of any Person will be most
fully <i>ridicul'd,</i> by naturally dressing yourself, or any
other Person in that Foible, and exerting its full Strength and
Vigour. </p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Politeness</span>
<i>of a Subject is the</i> Freedom <i>of that Subject from
all</i> Indelicacy, Aukardness, <i>and</i> Roughness.</p>

<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Good Breeding</span>
<i>consists in a</i> respectful <i>Carriage to others,
accompany'd with</i> Ease <i>and</i> Politeness.</p>

<p>It appears from hence that <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Good
Breeding</span> and <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Politeness</span> differ in this; that <span
class = "essaysmallcaps">Good Breeding</span> relates only to the
Manners of <span class = "pagenum">54</span><i>Persons</i> in
their Commerce together; Whereas Politeness may relate also to
<i>Books,</i> as well as to <i>Persons,</i> or to any Subjects of
Taste and Ornament.</p>

<p>So that <i>Politeness</i> may subsist in a Subject, as in a
<i>Cornish,</i> or <i>Architrave,</i> where <i>good Breeding</i>
can't enter; But it is impossible for <i>good Breeding</i> to be
offer'd without <i>Politeness</i>.</p>

<p>At the same time <i>good Breeding</i> is not to be understood,
as merely the <i>Politeness</i> of <i>Persons</i>; But as
<i>Respect,</i> tender'd with <i>Politeness,</i> in the Commerce
between <i>Persons</i>.</p>

<p>It is easy to perceive, that <i>good Breeding</i> is a
different Behaviour in different Countries, and in the same
Countries at different Periods, according to the Manners which
are us'd amongst <i>polite</i> Persons of those Places and
Seasons.</p>

<p>In <i>England</i> the chief Point of it <i>formerly</i> was
plac'd, in carrying a <i>Respect</i> in our Manners to all we
convers'd with; whence every Omission of the slightest Ceremony,
as it might be construed into a want of <i>Respect,</i> was
particularly to be avoided; So that  <i>good Breeding</i> became
then <i>a precise Observance and Exercise of all the Motions and
Ceremonies, expressive of Respect, which might justly be paid so
every Person</i>; --This, as it is easy to imagine, requir'd much
Nicety in the Adjustment upon many Occasions, and created immense
Trouble and Constraint, and most ridiculous Embarrassments.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<p>However, these Modes of <i>good Breeding</i> were not to be
abolished, as it was impossible to dispense with the
<i>Respect</i> annex'd to them, without some further Pretence
than of their <i>Inconvenience</i> only; which no Person could
decently urge, or admit in his own behalf, when it was his
Province to pay any Ceremonies to another; In this Difficulty it
was at last happily observ'd, for the Advantage of genteel
Commerce and Society, that <i>whatever gives Trouble, is
inconsistent with Respect</i>; Upon which Foundation, all
Ceremonies which create Embarrassments or Trouble to either Side,
are now justly exploded; And the <i>Ease</i> of each other is the
Point most peculiarly consulted by <i>well-bred</i> Persons.</p>

<p>If this Attention to <i>Ease</i> was properly conducted, so
that it might always appear to have <i>Respect</i> for its
Motive; And only to act in Obedience to <i>that,</i> as the
ruling Principle, it would then comprehend the just Plan of
<i>good Breeding</i>; But as <i>this</i> was formerly encumber'd
with Ceremonies and Embarrassments, so the modern <i>good
Breeding</i> perhaps deviates too far into Negligence and
Disregard;--A Fault more unpardonable than the former; As an
Inconvenience, evidently proceeding from the <i>Respect</i> which
is paid to us, may be easily excus'd; But a Freedom, which
carries the Air of <i>Neglect</i> with it, gives a lasting
Offence.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<p><span class = "essaysmallcaps">Beauty</span> <i>is the
delightful</i> Effect <i>which arises from the</i> joint Order,
Proportion, <i>and</i> Harmony <i>of all the Parts of an</i> Object.</p>

<p>And <i>to have a good</i> <span class = "essaysmallcaps">Taste</span>,
<i>is to have a just</i> Relish <i>of</i> <span class =
"essaysmallcaps">Beauty</span>.</p>

Be sure to become a subscriber; and take it upon yourself to see that
your college library is on the mailing list."</p>

<p>The Augustan Reprint Society is a non-profit, scholarly
organization, run without overhead expense. By careful management it
is able to offer at least six publications each year at the unusually
low membership fee of $2.50 per year in the United States and Canada,
and $2.75 in Great Britain and the continent.</p>

<p>Libraries as well as individuals are eligible for membership. Since
the publications are issued without profit, however, no discount can
be allowed to libraries, agents, or booksellers.</p>

<p>New members may still obtain a complete run of the first year's
publications for $2.50, the annual membership fee.</p>

<p>During the first two years the publications are issued in three
series: I. Essays on Wit; II. Essays on Poetry and Language; and III.
Essays on the Stage.</p>

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
